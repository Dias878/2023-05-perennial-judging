# BalancedVault.sol: V2 upgrade does not implement V1 functions which means users can lose access to their funds

## Summary
The current `BalancedVault` is meant as an upgrade for the current single market implementation of the `BalancedVault`.

We can see this in the initializer (initializing version 2):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L113

The issue is that shares in the V1 Vault are transferrable
https://github.com/equilibria-xyz/perennial-mono/blob/5ba9c9fc594cc476e9370bd68eb5ac7fd04bfc10/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/BalancedVault.sol#L215-L233

```solidity
    function transfer(address to, UFixed18 amount) external returns (bool) {
        _settle(msg.sender);
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Moves `amount` shares from `from to `to`
     * @param from Address to send shares from
     * @param to Address to send shares to
     * @param amount Amount of shares to send
     * @return bool true if the transfer was successful, otherwise reverts
     */
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, UFixed18 amount) external returns (bool) {
        _settle(from);
        _consumeAllowance(from, msg.sender, amount);
        _transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

However in the V2 implementation the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions have been removed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability can occur because based on V1 the `shares` might be managed by a contract that does not itself have the ability to redeem them.

However with the upgrade to V2, the assets corresponding to the shares get lost because the contract would not be able to transfer the shares somewhere else where they can be redeemed.

## Impact
Loss of funds because shares could not get redeemed.

Note that this scenario does not rely on a user error.
The shares might be owned by a smart contract and be subject to the logic of the contract. Thereby it's not possible that the smart contract just transfers them somewhere where they can be redeemed before the V2 upgrade.

V2 `BalancedVault`:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions in the V2 `BalancedVault` such as to not break compatibility.
