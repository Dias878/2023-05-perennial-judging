# BalancedVault doesn't have ability to claim and distribute rewards among holders

## Summary
BalancedVault doesn't have ability to claim and distribute rewards among holders.
## Vulnerability Detail
`BalancedVault` uses deposited by users funds in order to open position in oposite markets.
For example it can use eth long/short products. 

Each product can have rewards programs inside Incentivizer contract. This rewards are earned by traders of a product and later they [can claim them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/incentivizer/Incentivizer.sol#L138-L143). Trader can claim rewards for himself only, it's not possible to do that for someone else.

The problem is that `BalancedVault` contract doesn't have ability to claim that rewards, however it will be earning them a lot, because of big amount of positions.  As result this rewards will never be received by vault and distributed by stakers.
## Impact
Rewards can't be claimed.

## Recommendation
Add ability to claim this rewards in order to swap them to the collateral asset and distribute among vault users.
