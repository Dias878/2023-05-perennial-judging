# Assuming USDC peg is dangerous because USDC can depeg from USD

## Summary
The protocol uses Chainlink USD denominated price feeds.
The collateral is USDC (wrapped as DSU).

If USDC depegs from USD this can lead to severe consequences in terms of wrong PnL accounting.

## Vulnerability Detail
We've only recently on March 6th seen that a USDC depeg scenario is not unrealistic.
USDC dropped at times close to 0.8 USD.

In this situation 1 USDC collateral would wrongly count as 1 USD collateral.

E.g. an attacker could buy cheap USDC and trade with 1 USD collateral. He wouldn't have to fully cover his losses.

Also the winning traders would get less profit because they are paid out in USDC.

## Impact
A USDC depeg event leads to wrong PnL accounting which can be abused by users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The protocol should check (together with fetching the latest USD denominated price) if the USDC - USD peg is still valid (e.g. using Uniswap price). 
If USDC has depegged the protocol should pause such that it's at least not possible for an attacker to exploit the situation.
