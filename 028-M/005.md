# ChainlinkAggregator.sol: _tryGetProxyRoundData function needs to check that roundId is not zero

## Summary
The `ChainlinkAggregator._search` function which is used to search for valid `roundId`s makes use of the `ChainlinkAggregator._tryGetProxyRoundData` function which provides a safe interface (error handling) for calling the Aggregator Proxy.

The checks in the `ChainlinkAggregator._tryGetProxyRoundData` function are insufficient such that an invalid round may be treated as valid.

## Vulnerability Detail
The checks that should be applied when the Aggregator Proxy is called to get round data are the following:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L70-L75

However the `nextRoundId=0` check is missing here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L158-L165

The problem is that the `timestamp` may be greater zero but the round id may still be zero, indicating an invalid round.
This is because in the case of an invalid round, the Chainlink behavior is not clearly defined, i.e. it's not defined whether the timestamp must also be zero if the round is zero (invalid).

Note: 
The same check should be added here as well:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L108-L109

However here it's not strictly necessary because the check would be replicated downstream in the `_tryGetProxyRoundData` function.

## Impact
An invalid round may falsely be treated as a valid round such that the Oracle exposes a wrong price to the Perennial application.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend adding the check for `roundId` to properly check for an invalid round:
