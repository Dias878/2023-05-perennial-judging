# XO-`_payoffFromContract()` function could allow for invalid `Fixed18` values to be returned

## Summary
- The vulnerability is in the `_payoffFromContract()` function, the `payoff` function on the underlying contract returns a valid `Fixed18` value. This means that an attacker could create a contract that implements the `IContractPayoffProvider` interface and returns an invalid `Fixed18` value from the `payoff` function. 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
*/
  function _payoffFromContract(
    PayoffDefinition memory self,
    Fixed18 price
  ) private view returns (Fixed18) {
    bytes memory ret = address(_providerContract(self)).functionStaticCall(
      abi.encodeCall(IContractPayoffProvider.payoff, price)
    );
    return Fixed18.wrap(abi.decode(ret, (int256)));
  }
}
/**
```
- The vulnerability exist in the `_payoffFromContract()` function. This function is used to get the `payoff` from a contract that implements the `IContractPayoffProvider` interface. The vulnerability is that the function does not check to see if the `payoff` function on the underlying contract returns a valid `Fixed18` value. This means that an attacker could create a contract that implements the `IContractPayoffProvider` interface and returns an invalid `Fixed18` value from the `payoff` function. If the attacker is able to do this, then the `_payoffFromContract()` function will return an invalid `Fixed18` value, which could lead to unintended consequences.
## Impact
- an attacker can exploit the vulnerability and cause the contract to lose funds or to give the attacker control of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  adding a check to the `_payoffFromContract()` function to see if the `payoff` function on the underlying contract returns a valid `Fixed18` value.
