# Liquidating an account may cause collateral balance of the account to go below `minCollateral`

## Summary
There is a minimum collateral that is set in the Controller contract. This disallows users from depositing collateral that would make collateral balance less than minimum Collateral, and prevents withdraws that would make the collateral balance less than minimum collateral.
This issue explains how an account can cause his collateral balance to go below the minCollateral and even open positions with it, hence defeating the purpose of minCollateral

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is how the protocol calculates the liquidation fee that would be deducted from the account.
```solidity
UFixed18 liquidationFee = controller().liquidationFee();
UFixed18 collateralForFee = UFixed18Lib.max(totalMaintenance, controller().minCollateral());
UFixed18 fee = UFixed18Lib.min(totalCollateral, collateralForFee.mul(liquidationFee)); 
_products[product].debitAccount(account, fee);
```
The `fee` is the minimum of `totalCollateral` and `collateralForFee.mul(liquidationFee)` which means that if fee is not `totalCollateral`, there is a possibility that the fee could be large enough to make `totalCollateral` fall below `minCollateral`

Consider this scenario:
- There is ETH-long product on Ethereum Mainnet with following configurations:
    - minimum collateral of 100 USDC
    - liquidation fee = 20%
    - maintenance=0.05, max leverage=20
    - ETH price=$1750
- UserA deposit collateral of 100 USDC(equal to min collateral)
- UserA opens maker position of 1.143ETH at 20x leverage
- Price of ETH rises to $1800 so account immediately becomes liquidatable because account used max leverage
- UserA liquidates his account:
    - collateralForFee=max((1800 * 1.143 * 0.05),100)=$102.87
    - fee=min(100,(102.87 * 20%))=$20.574
- liquidation fee that would be deducted from UserA's collateral balance is $20.574
- UserA's account balance=100-20.574=$79.43 which is less than minCollateral of $100
- UserA can now open new positions using his collateral balance that is less than minCollateral

One of the purposes of minCollateral is to allow for gas costs that would cover liquidation.
- UserA can calculate a collateral balance that would be less than gas costs on ethereum to dissuade liquidators from liquidating his account even when his collateral balance is well below the required maintenance.


## Impact
A user can cause his collateral balance to be any value, even below minCollateral. With this power, he can make his collateral balance such that there would be no incentive to liquidate it.
Now, even when massive changes in Product's token price causes his collateral balance to be far less than the maintenance required, User's account may not be liquidated as there are no incentives.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a mapping called "unused collateral"
When liquidating an account, if deducting liquidation fee causes account's balance to be less than minCollateral, increment the account's "unused collateral" balance by the account's balance, and change the `OptimisticLedger` balance of that account to 0.
The "unused collateral" balances should not be used in any internal accounting, and should be claimable by the user at anytime.
