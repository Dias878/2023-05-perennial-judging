# First depositor can break minting of shares

## Summary
First depositor can break minting of shares

## Vulnerability Detail
ERC4626 vaults are subject to a share price manipulation attack that allows an attacker to steal underlying tokens from other depositors:

1. Alice is the first depositor of the vault;
2. Alice deposits 1 wei of token A;
3. in the deposit function, the amount of shares is calculated using the deposit function:
4. since Alice is the first depositor (totalSupply is 0), she gets 1 share (1 wei);
5. Alice then sends 9999999999999999999 token A (10e18 - 1) to the vault;
6. the price of 1 share is 10 token A now: Alice is the only depositor in the vault, she's holding 1 wei of shares, and the balance of the pool is 10 token A;
7. Bob deposits 19  token A and gets only 1 share due to the rounding in the convertToShares function: 19e18 * 1 / 10e18 == 1;
8. Alice redeems her share and gets a half of the deposited assets, 14.5 tokens;
9. Bob redeems his share and gets only 14.5 amount of token, instead of the 19 tokens he deposited.

## Impact
Tokens can be stolen from depositors in BalancedVault by manipulating the price of a share.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
On the first deposit, consider minting a fixed and high amount of shares, irrespective of the deposited amount. Or consider sending first 1000 wei of shares to the zero address. This will significantly increase the cost of the attack by forcing an attacker to pay 1000 times of the share price they want to set. For a well-intended user, 1000 wei of shares is a negligible amount that won't diminish their share significantly.
