# Liquidation Reverts

## Summary
Liquidation cannot occur when contract is paused

## Vulnerability Detail
Different market conditions can cause liquidation to happen at any point, but this contract cannot liquidate users if the contract is paused. Even when the liquidation bots are active, I believe this should be amended
```solidity
     //@audit-issue cannot liquidate user when contract is paused
    function liquidate(address account, IProduct product)
    external
    nonReentrant
    notPaused
    isProduct(product)
    settleForAccount(account, product)
```
## Impact
Liquidation fails and protocol looses funds that could have been protected if liquidation was possible.
