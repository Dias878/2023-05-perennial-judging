# Incorrect oracle price will pass when chainlink data hit minimum answer

## Summary
Chainlink aggregators have a circuit breaker mechanism and if the price of an asset goes outside of a price range that is set ahead of time. The oracle will continue to return minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset.
## Vulnerability Detail
In ChainlinkOracle.sol `sync()`, chainlink price is returned with insufficient checks - only returned roundId and timestamp are non-zero values are checked. 
```solidity
//ChainlinkOracle.sol
    function sync() external returns (OracleVersion memory) {
        // Fetch latest round
        ChainlinkRound memory round = registry.getLatestRound(base, quote);
        // Revert if the round id or timestamp is 0
        if (uint64(round.roundId) == 0 || round.timestamp == 0) revert InvalidOracleRound();
       ...
```
In ChainlinkRegistry.sol `getLatestRound()`, the price answer is not checked either.
```solidity
//ChainlinkRegistry.sol
    function getLatestRound(ChainlinkRegistry self, address base, address quote) internal view returns (ChainlinkRound memory) {
        (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) =
            FeedRegistryInterface(ChainlinkRegistry.unwrap(self)).latestRoundData(base, quote);
        return ChainlinkRound({roundId: roundId, timestamp: updatedAt, answer: answer});
    }
```
ChainlinkFeedRegistry pulls the associated aggregator and requests round data from it. ChainlinkAggregators have minPrice and maxPrice circuit breakers built into them. If a price drops below the minPrice, the protocol will still report the minPrice. This allows unfair valuations of PnL, potentially leading to mass liquidations.
## Impact
In LUNA crash, this is exactly what happens, chainlink reports a preset minimum price which is higher than market price, leading to a loss of users and defi protocols with naive implementations. When minPrice is passed, this allows unfair valuations of PnL leading to unfair user loss and potentially mass liquidations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a secondary on-chain liquidity-based oracle like Uniswap TWAP to check for the price difference. Revert when price difference is too high.
