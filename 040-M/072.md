# Inconsistent pricing in balanced vault may lead to incorrect withdrawals

## Summary
Handling some prices for markets in balanced vaults are handled inconsistently, may lead to blocked withdrawals

## Vulnerability Detail
Perennial vault uses an evaluation of collateral relative to positions value to evaluate the maximum of redeemable shares.

It uses this formula for currentPrice in `_maxRedeem`:

And this formula for currentPrice in `_rebalance`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L486

Which means that in the case where there is a difference between short and long oracle versions, a different price will be used. In the first case the oracle version used is `min(latest_long_oracle_version, latest_short_oracle_version)`, and in the second it is always the latest version of long which is used.

A price inconsistency means that either the redeemer gets a lesser amount than what expected, 
either she gets a bit more which means the protocol takes on more risk.

## Impact
The balanced vault does not rebalance correctly and may be more at risk of being liquidated.

## Recommendation
Use the same pricing formula for all of these evaluations (which have the same goal).
