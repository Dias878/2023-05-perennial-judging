# MultiInvoker contract will fail if controller owner updates the collateral address

## Summary
The MultiInvoker contract's design, which has the collateral address set as immutable, may lead to operational issues. This problem arises when the controller's contract owner changes the collateral contract. The persisting link to the outdated collateral in the MultiInvoker contract could cause its functions to fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, the MultiInvoker contract keeps the collateral address as an immutable variable. However, the controller's contract owner has the power to modify the collateral contract. In such scenarios, the MultiInvoker's functions interacting with the collateral might malfunction. This is due to the collateral address pointing to the old, unused collateral instead of the new one, resulting in any product interactions being directed towards an outdated contract.
## Impact
At worst, users can't use the MultiInvoker, but I don't see if user funds can be stolen or stuck so I'll label it as medium.

this is how product calls the collateral, not hardcoded.
