# Incentivizer.complete doesn't sync last oracle version

## Summary
`Incentivizer.complete` doesn't sync last oracle version, because of that `product.currentVersion` returns outdated result and program owner can receive more funds back then he should.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Incentivizer.complete` function is allowed to be called by product coordinator in order to finish reward program. As result part of funds will be returned to the coordinator and another part should stay to pay rewards.
This function [calls program manager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/incentivizer/Incentivizer.sol#L88) to finish program, which [will then call program](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/incentivizer/types/ProductManager.sol#L200).

```solidity
    function complete(
        Program storage self,
        IProduct product,
        ProgramInfo memory programInfo
    ) internal returns (uint256 versionComplete) {
        uint256 versionStarted = self.versionStarted;
        versionComplete = Math.max(versionStarted, product.latestVersion());
        self.versionComplete = versionComplete;


        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory fromOracleVersion = product.atVersion(versionStarted);
        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory toOracleVersion = product.atVersion(versionComplete);


        uint256 inactiveDuration = programInfo.duration - (toOracleVersion.timestamp - fromOracleVersion.timestamp);
        UFixed18 refundAmount = programInfo.amount.sum().muldiv(inactiveDuration, programInfo.duration);
        self.available = self.available.sub(refundAmount);
        address treasury = IIncentivizer(address(this)).treasury(programInfo.coordinatorId);
        self.settled[treasury] = self.settled[treasury].add(refundAmount);
    }
```

In order to understand how many time program is already active, `product.latestVersion()` is used. The problem is that this version can be stale and it needs to be updated to the current lates oracle config using `sync` function. As result `product.latestVersion()` function will show old value and coordinator will receive more funds back.
## Impact
Coordinator will receive more funds back and less rewards will be distributed.

## Recommendation
You need to `sync` product's oracle to get last oracle version.
