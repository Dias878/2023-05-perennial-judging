# Chainlink's latestRoundData() Returns Stale or Incorrect Result



## Summary

The contracts in ecosystem that are chainlink-prefixed use the `latestRoundData()` function to fetch price data. However, these contracts do not perform any checks to ensure that the returned prices are not stale. This vulnerability exposes the protocol to potential risks associated with using outdated or incorrect price data.

## Vulnerability Detail

In multiple Chainlink-prefixed contracts, a call to `latestRoundData()` is made either directly or indirectly, but no checks are implemented to validate the freshness of the prices returned. This means that the protocol may use stale prices for critical operations, which can lead to inaccurate calculations and incorrect decision-making.

An example of such usage can be found in the [ChainlinkAggregator.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/0f73469508a4cd3d90b382eac2112f012a5a9852/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L32-L36) contract.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that the protocol may rely on outdated or incorrect price data, which can have severe consequences. Inaccurate prices can result in incorrect valuations, improper risk management, and potential financial losses for users of the protocol.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable code snippet can be found in [ChainlinkAggregator.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/0f73469508a4cd3d90b382eac2112f012a5a9852/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L32-L36).
And almost all other Chainlink-prefixed contracts

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement checks for stale data when retrieving prices from the Chainlink oracles.
