# No checking for status of L2 sequencer on whether it is active or not

## Summary
No checking for status of L2 sequencer on whether it is active or not

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol intends to deploy on L2 chain Arbitrum in which it relies on its sequencer for Chainlink price update.
However, Chainlink recommends the user of price oracles to check its sequencer whether it is active or not.

If there is no proper checking of L2 sequencer status, the index oracle may provide stale prices while the sequencer is down.


## Impact
There will be false liquidations incidents as a result of stale prices.
