# `sync()` doesn't check whether Arbitrum sequencer is down

## Summary
Downtimes happen more often than not on L2s so it is important to validate if Arbitrum sequencer is operational before any state-changing operation occurs. This is to ensure that the prices are fresh and not stale so that users will not be harmed while actively managing their positions.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ChainlinkFeedOracle`'s and `ChainlinkOracle`'s `sync()` function there is no check if the sequencer is down. E.g. ChainlinkOracle code:
```solidity
function sync() external returns (OracleVersion memory) {
        // Fetch latest round
        ChainlinkRound memory round = registry.getLatestRound(base, quote);

        // Revert if the round id or timestamp is 0
        if (uint64(round.roundId) == 0 || round.timestamp == 0) revert InvalidOracleRound();

        // Update phase annotation when new phase detected
        while (round.phaseId() > _latestPhaseId()) {
            _phases.push(
                Phase(
                    uint128(registry.getRoundCount(base, quote, _latestPhaseId())) +
                        _phases[_phases.length - 1].startingVersion,
                    uint128(registry.getStartingRoundId(base, quote, _latestPhaseId() +  1))
                )
            );
        }

        // Return packaged oracle version
        return _buildOracleVersion(round);
    }
```

## Impact
Users with assumptions that the prices are not stale could be potentially harmed while actively managing their positions.
