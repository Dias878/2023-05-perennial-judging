# Chainlink price feed is lacking the sequencer uptime check

## Summary
Chainlink price feed missing sequencer uptime validation.
## Vulnerability Detail
The best practice when using chainlink in L2's is to check the sequencer if it's alive or not and then move on with the validation of the chainlink oracle price feed returns. Current code is missing the sequencer checks on chainlink. If the sequencer is not up chainlink price might be stale or outdated.
## Impact
Since the protocol is running on an optimistic rollup I'll label it as medium.

## Recommendation
Use sequencer uptime feed to check whether the sequencer is running or its offline
