# Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Summary

Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active


## Vulnerability Detail

It has been made clear that perennial will be deployed on arbitrum as well,

Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum sequencer is active

https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds

If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.

## Impact

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow orders to be executed while the sequencer is offline.
