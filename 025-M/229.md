# L2 Sequencer Unhandled for Arbitrum and Optimism

## Summary
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum and Optimism requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.

The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check in 
```solidity
    function getLatestRound(ChainlinkRegistry self, address base, address quote) internal view returns (ChainlinkRound memory) {
        (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) =
            FeedRegistryInterface(ChainlinkRegistry.unwrap(self)).latestRoundData(base, quote);
        return ChainlinkRound({roundId: roundId, timestamp: updatedAt, answer: answer});
    }
```
## Impact
Stale prices could be potentially exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
