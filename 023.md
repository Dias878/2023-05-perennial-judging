# No check sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
No check sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds
## Vulnerability Detail
**answer** data returned in latestRoundData(), representing sequencer ,

// Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
// Answer == 1: Sequencer is down

There is no check that the sequencer is down
```solidity
    function getLatestRound(ChainlinkAggregator self) internal view returns (ChainlinkRound memory) {
        (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) =
            AggregatorProxyInterface(ChainlinkAggregator.unwrap(self)).latestRoundData();
        return ChainlinkRound({roundId: roundId, timestamp: updatedAt, answer: answer});
    }

```
It is recommended to follow the code example of Chainlink:

## Recommendation
```solidity
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }
