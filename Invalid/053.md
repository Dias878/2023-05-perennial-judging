# Potential Overflow in ChainlinkFeedOracle and ChainlinkOracle

## Summary
In the `ChainlinkFeedOracle.sol` and `ChainlinkOracle.sol`, there's a potential for integer overflow in the `sync` function when calculating `version` which could lead to unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `sync` function in both contracts involves adding a `roundId` (which is an unbounded uint256) to a `startingVersion` (also an unbounded uint256). This could potentially result in an overflow.

## Impact
If an overflow occurs, the `version` could become much smaller than intended. This could impact any logic that depends on the version being an accurate representation of the phase's progression.

## Code Snippet

For ChainlinkFeedOracle:

```solidity
uint256 version = uint256(phase.startingVersion) + round.roundId - uint256(phase.startingRoundId);
```

For ChainlinkOracle:

```solidity
uint256 version = uint256(phase.startingVersion) + round.roundId - uint256(phase.startingRoundId);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing overflow checks when performing arithmetic operations. OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library provides functions that automatically check for overflows and underflows.

## Proof of Concept
Reproducing this issue would require a situation where the `roundId` and `startingVersion` are both extremely large. While unlikely in practice, it's theoretically possible, and the contract should be resilient against such edge cases. If this situation were to occur, the addition would result in an overflow.
