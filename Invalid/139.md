# Incentive program refunds are not claimable

## Summary

Incentive program rewards are not claimable

## Vulnerability Detail

When a program is complete, the refund amount is added to `settled[treasury]`.

```solidity
    function complete(
        Program storage self,
        IProduct product,
        ProgramInfo memory programInfo
    ) internal returns (uint256 versionComplete) {
        ...
        self.settled[treasury] = self.settled[treasury].add(refundAmount);
    }
```

The refund amount is never pushed to the treasury after this and there is no functionality to claim it.

## Impact

Refund amount can not be claimed.
