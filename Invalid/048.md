# Insecure Product Creation Vulnerability

## Summary

The `Controller.sol` contract may allow the creation of products without proper authorization.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `Controller.sol` contract, the `createProduct` function allows any owner of a coordinator to create a new product. However, there are no checks to verify whether the coordinator owner is a trusted entity. This could lead to the creation of malicious products, potentially harming the system.

## Impact

If exploited, an attacker could create malicious products that behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to financial loss for users who interact with these products. Additionally, the introduction of malicious products could undermine the system's trust and reputation.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function createProduct(uint256 coordinatorId, IProduct.ProductInfo calldata productInfo)
    external onlyOwner(coordinatorId) returns (IProduct) {
    if (coordinatorId == 0) revert ControllerNoZeroCoordinatorError();

    BeaconProxy newProductProxy = new BeaconProxy(address(productBeacon()), abi.encodeCall(IProduct.initialize, productInfo));
    IProduct newProduct = IProduct(address(newProductProxy));
    coordinatorFor[newProduct] = coordinatorId;
    emit ProductCreated(newProduct, productInfo);

    return newProduct;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement additional checks to ensure that only trusted entities can create products. This could involve using a whitelist of trusted coordinator owners or requiring additional confirmation before a product is created.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy the `Controller` contract on a mainnet fork.
2. As an arbitrary address, create a coordinator and assign its ownership to this address.
3. Call the `createProduct` function from the address of the new coordinator owner.
4. Check the system to see if a new product has been created without proper authorization.
