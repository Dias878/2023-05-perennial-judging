# BalancedVault.claim() exposes users to unlimited slippage

## Summary
BalancedVault.claim() exposes users to unlimited slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail
Examine [BalancedVault.claim()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L211-L228):
```solidity
function claim(address account) external {
	(EpochContext memory context, ) = _settle(account);

	UFixed18 unclaimedAmount = _unclaimed[account];
	UFixed18 unclaimedTotal = _totalUnclaimed;
	_unclaimed[account] = UFixed18Lib.ZERO;
	_totalUnclaimed = unclaimedTotal.sub(unclaimedAmount);
	emit Claim(msg.sender, account, unclaimedAmount);

	// pro-rate if vault has less collateral than unclaimed
	UFixed18 claimAmount = unclaimedAmount;
	UFixed18 totalCollateral = _assets();
	if (totalCollateral.lt(unclaimedTotal)) claimAmount = claimAmount.muldiv(totalCollateral, unclaimedTotal);

	_rebalance(context, claimAmount);

	asset.push(account, claimAmount);
}
```
* ``claimAmount`` is initially set to ``unclaimedAmount`` which is ``_unclaimed[account]``, the user's unclaimed amount
* then a check is made if the ``totalCollateral <= unclaimedTotal``
* if this is the case, ``claimAmount`` is adjusted such that the user will not receive the full ``claimAmount`` they would have received if ``totalCollateral >= unclaimedTotal ``
* ``unclaimedTotal`` is determined by reading on-chain storage ``_totalUnclaimed``
* ``totalCollateral`` is determined in [BalancedVault._assets()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L760-L767) by reading on-chain storage ``asset.balanceOf()`` & ``collateral`` for every market in ``totalMarkets``

When the user initiates a claim() transaction, ``totalCollateral >= unclaimedTotal `` could be ``true``. However the user's transaction could be front-run by other market participants, or could be delayed due to a spike in gas costs from a popular nft mint, or being held by a hostile validator.

As there is no expiration deadline parameter that the user can set nor any slippage parameter, by the time their transaction actually gets executed the on-chain parameters used to calculate ``unclaimedTotal`` & ``totalCollateral`` could have been changed due to the actions of other market participants such that  ``totalCollateral >= unclaimedTotal `` now equals ``false``. This would result in the user receiving less output than expected.

BalancedVault.claim() is roughly equivalent to a swap with [No Slippage Parameter](https://dacian.me/defi-slippage-attacks#heading-no-slippage-parameter) & [No Expiration Deadline](https://dacian.me/defi-slippage-attacks#heading-no-expiration-deadline) where the output amount depends upon on-chain parameters that could be different from when the user initiates the transaction to when the transaction actually gets executed. This is similar to the known slippage vulnerability class [Minting Exposes Users To Unlimited Slippage](https://dacian.me/defi-slippage-attacks#heading-minting-exposes-users-to-unlimited-slippage).

## Impact
User may receive less output than expected.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enable user to specify a slippage parameter and optionally an expiration deadline. It seems (to me at least) like the current design of BalancedVault.redeem() & claim() makes it very hard to provide the user with slippage control, since the shares are burned in redeem() but the output is only received in claim().
