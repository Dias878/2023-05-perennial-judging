# Product's Flywheel Dependency on Oracle Updates is a Downside

## Summary

The product's flywheel in protocol is dependent on continuous updates from an oracle. However, if the oracle stops updating, it can lead to a stagnant state where the flywheel stops spinning. This creates a significant downside as the protocol and vault become extensively stuck.
It is important to note that oracles can go offline for various reasons, such as maintenance or token prices falling to zero. In such cases, the flywheel won't spin, resulting in halted operations due to the unavailability of updated data.

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently, only one oracle source is integrated into the protocol (chainlink), exacerbating the issue.

Chainlink, a popular oracle provider, has taken oracles offline in extreme cases to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data. For instance, during the UST collapse, Chainlink temporarily paused the UST/ETH price oracle to prevent the dissemination of inaccurate data to protocols.

## Impact

The dependency on the oracle updates for the product's flywheel poses a significant risk. If an oracle goes down or stops updating, the flywheel will cease to function, leaving the protocol and vault(extensively) in a stucked state. This can have far-reaching consequences, including the inability to execute crucial operations and potential financial losses for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce Safeguards: Implement a safeguard mechanism to protect against potential issues arising from oracle downtimes or failures. This can involve integrating fallback or backup oracles that can be activated in case the primary oracle becomes unresponsive. This redundancy will help ensure the availability of updated data and enable the flywheel to continue spinning.
