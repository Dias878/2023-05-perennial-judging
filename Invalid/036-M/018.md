# MultiInvokerRollup.sol: address cached at index 0 can cause unintended functionality to be executed

## Summary
The `MultiInvokerRollup` contract employs a custom encoding scheme and it's important that no address is "cached" at index 0 of the `addressCache` array.

That's because a zero byte signals a different encoding scheme (namely that the address is encoded in the calldata, as opposed to needs to be looked up in the cache).

This means that by following the encoding rules, i.e. using the index from the `addressCache` array, the user would end up using a different encoding scheme such that all of the encoded data from this position onward is processed differently and unintended operations can be executed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The first observation we need to make is that the MultiInvoker is supposed to be deployed behind a proxy.
We can see this by looking at the current deployment of the MultiInvoker: https://etherscan.io/address/0xE77076D3EeE12dA1d7402Ff4e6Ca12A8d99FcE8B

The problem is that the zero address is cached in the constructor which means this does not affect the storage of the proxy:
(caching the zero address is done such that no cached address is indexed at 0, such that this issue cannot occur)

Therefore the first cached address in the `addressCache` will have index zero:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/multiinvoker/MultiInvokerRollup.sol#L40

So when the user would encode data and wants to use this cached address, he would use index 0.

However we can see that a zero byte has a special meaning:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/multiinvoker/MultiInvokerRollup.sol#L21-L26

It's used when instead of using a cached address, an actual address within the encoded calldata is used.

## Impact
The `MultiInvokerRollup` contract would interpret the encoded data differently than the user intends and execute unintended operations.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Caching the zero address should be moved from the constructor to an initializer (override the initializer from `MultiInvoker` parent contract).
