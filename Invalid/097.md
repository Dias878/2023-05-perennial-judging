# XO-`Recursive` call to `nonReentrant` function possible due to race condition

## Summary
- The vulnerability is in the `nonReentrant` function that is can be called recursively due to a race condition. because `the _status.read()` function is not `deterministic`. This means that it is possible for the value of `_status` to change between the `time` that the function is called and the time that the value is read.
## Vulnerability Detail
```SOLIDITY
*/
    modifier nonReentrant() {
        // On the first call to nonReentrant, _notEntered will be true
        if (_status.read() == _ENTERED) revert UReentrancyGuardReentrantCallError();

        // Any calls to nonReentrant after this point will fail
        _status.store(_ENTERED);

        _;

        // By storing the original value once again, a refund is triggered (see
        // https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200)
        _status.store(_NOT_ENTERED);
    }
}
```
- There is a vulnerability  in the `nonReentrant` function, especially in line
`if (_status.read() == _ENTERED) revert UReentrancyGuardReentrantCallError();`, this line  is vulnerable to a `race condition`. This is because the `_status.read()` function is not `deterministic`. This means that it is possible for the value of `_status` to change between the time that the function is called and the time that the value is read, this vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to call the `nonReentrant` function recursively. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the contract, which could lead to the loss of funds or other damage.
## Impact
- The vulnerability could allows an attacker to call the `nonReentrant` function recursively. and lead to the loss of funds or other damage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Using a deterministic way to check the value of `_status`. For example, you could use the `block.coinbase` or `block.timestamp` variables to ensure that the value of `_status` has not changed.
