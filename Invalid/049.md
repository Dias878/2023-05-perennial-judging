# Cross-chain Restricted Modification Vulnerability

## Summary

The `UCrossChainOwnable.sol` contract may allow modification of the cross-chain restriction state without proper authorization.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `UCrossChainOwnable.sol` contract, the `_beforeAcceptOwner` function modifies the `_crossChainRestricted` variable if the cross-chain restriction is not set. However, there isn't a restriction on who can call this function, potentially allowing any user to modify the cross-chain restriction status.

## Impact

If exploited, an attacker could manipulate cross-chain restrictions, potentially causing unauthorized cross-chain transactions or interactions. This could disrupt the contract's intended functionality and compromise the integrity of transactions.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _beforeAcceptOwner() internal override {
    if (!crossChainRestricted()) _crossChainRestricted.store(true);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a function modifier to `_beforeAcceptOwner` that only allows the contract's owner or a designated administrator to modify the cross-chain restriction status.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy the `UCrossChainOwnable` contract on a mainnet fork.
2. Call the `_beforeAcceptOwner` function from an address that is not the contract's owner or a designated administrator.
3. Check the `_crossChainRestricted` variable to see if it has been modified.
