# BalancedVault.sol#L137 : `sync()` can be called by anyone which would hurt the user when the market has negative fluctuations.

## Summary

function [sync()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L137) is public and can be called by anyone.

This call will do the following actions, rebalance the maker and taker positions and settle the account.

Since the account would be zero address when the sync function is called, it will not cause any issue for account related operations.

But, since the  `_rebalance` is called during the sync process, the `_rebalance` do the rebalance for collateral as well as for position.

This would be updating the positions and collateral values unnecessarily.

## Vulnerability Detail

sync- can be called by anyone.

    function sync() external {
        syncAccount(address(0)); -------- called.
    }

    function syncAccount(address account) public {
        (EpochContext memory context, ) = _settle(account);
        _rebalance(context, UFixed18Lib.ZERO); -------->> called

when we look at the _rebalance function , it will update the collateral and posittion.

    function _rebalance(EpochContext memory context, UFixed18 claimAmount) private {
        _rebalanceCollateral(claimAmount);
        _rebalancePosition(context, claimAmount);

When the market is negative fluctuations, the rate of token would be less. Syncing suring this time would lead to settling the collateral and positions with less values


## Impact

This would hurt the user balance when the market is in negative fluctuations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add modifier so that only the keeper would call this function or check valid account is calling.
