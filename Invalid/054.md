# Race condition on approvals of vault token

## Summary
Approvals can be frontrun by the spender
## Vulnerability Detail
If an owner of a vault token approves a spender, that approval is set. Should the owner wish to modify the spender's approval level, they need to call the approve function again. If the spender notices the new approval transaction, they can spend their current allowance before the new approve transaction is processed. Then, once the new approval is applied at the end of the block, they essentially benefit from an extra allowance.

Consider this scenario:
Bob owns 1000 vault tokens. He approves Alice to spend 100 of his vault tokens. After some time, Bob decides to increase Alice's approval to 200 and signs the transaction. However, Alice notices this pending transaction in the mempool and decides to spend her current 100-token allowance before Bob's new approval is processed. At the end of the block, Bob's new approval comes into effect, granting Alice an allowance of 200 tokens. Thus, Alice benefits from the 100 tokens she spent earlier without it affecting her newly increased allowance.
