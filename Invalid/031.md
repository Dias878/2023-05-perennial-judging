# Program can fail to complete with inactiveDuration underflows

## Summary
Program can fail to complete with inactiveDuration underflows.

## Vulnerability Detail
At Program, a program is started by having the versionStarted cached, at completion, it would take the latestVersion and calculate any inactiveDuration during the program.

1. Assume a program is started exactly at the startTime. 
2. The program is only closed after the duration T, plus 1 second.
3. The `complete - start` time span is longer than duration now.

```solidity
    function complete(
        Program storage self,
        IProduct product,
        ProgramInfo memory programInfo
    ) internal returns (uint256 versionComplete) {
        uint256 versionStarted = self.versionStarted;
        versionComplete = Math.max(versionStarted, product.latestVersion());
        self.versionComplete = versionComplete;

        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory fromOracleVersion = product.atVersion(versionStarted);
        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory toOracleVersion = product.atVersion(versionComplete);

>>>underflow        uint256 inactiveDuration = programInfo.duration - (toOracleVersion.timestamp - fromOracleVersion.timestamp); 
        UFixed18 refundAmount = programInfo.amount.sum().muldiv(inactiveDuration, programInfo.duration);
        self.available = self.available.sub(refundAmount);
        address treasury = IIncentivizer(address(this)).treasury(programInfo.coordinatorId);
        self.settled[treasury] = self.settled[treasury].add(refundAmount);
    }
```

ProgramManager call _start and _complete during sync to interact with Program
```solidity
    function sync(
        ProductManager storage self,
        IProduct product,
        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory currentOracleVersion
    ) internal returns (SyncResult[] memory results) {

        uint256[] memory activeProgramIds = self.activePrograms.values();
        results = new SyncResult[](activeProgramIds.length);

        for (uint256 i; i < activeProgramIds.length; i++) {
            // Load program
            uint256 programId = activeProgramIds[i];
            ProgramInfo memory programInfo = self.programInfos[programId];
            Program storage program = self.programs[programId];

            // If timestamp-started, grab current version (first version after start)
            uint256 versionStarted;
            if (program.versionStarted == 0 && programInfo.isStarted(currentOracleVersion.timestamp)) {
                versionStarted = _start(self, programId, currentOracleVersion);
            }

            // If timestamp-completed, grab previous version (last version before completion)
            uint256 versionComplete;
            if (program.versionComplete == 0 && programInfo.isComplete(currentOracleVersion.timestamp)) {
                versionComplete = _complete(self, product, programId);
            }

            // Save result
            results[i] = SyncResult(programId, versionStarted, versionComplete);
        }
    }
```

A program can be started at or after startTime
```solidity
    function isStarted(ProgramInfo memory self, uint256 timestamp) internal pure returns (bool) {
        return timestamp >= self.start;
    }

```

A program can be completed at or after  `start + duration`
```solidity
    function isComplete(ProgramInfo memory self, uint256 timestamp) internal pure returns (bool) {
        return timestamp >= (self.start + self.duration);
    }
```

## Recommendation
check if the `toOracleVersion.timestamp - fromOracleVersion.timestamp` underflows.
