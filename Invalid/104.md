# Leveraged trader with small collateral can create a riskless position until settlement

## Summary
A highly leveraged trader (around max leverage) with small collateral can autoliquidate position to create a riskless position

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see in closeTake function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/product/Product.sol#L246-L256

- maintenanceInvariant is not enforced, meaning that extraction of `takerFee` can make the position go unhealthy

And in `liquidate`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/collateral/Collateral.sol#L128-L129

- minimum liquidation incentive equals `liquidationFee*minCollateral`.
Which is constant and equal to 0.5 DSU on arbitrum products such as:
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5E660B7B8357059241EAEc143e1e68A5A108D035

We can deduce that a highly leveraged trader, with very small collateral (0.5 DSU) can create a riskless position lasting until next settlement by auto liquidating.

Example:
Maintenance factor is 2%
Liquidation fee is 5%
Taker fee is 0.1%
Funding fee is 0%

Alice has a 50x leverage `taker` position opened as authorized per maintenance invariant:

Alice collateral: 0.5 DSU
Alice taker position: notional of 25 DSU

To create the riskless position Alice does in the same tx:
- closes the taker position (and by paying the `takerFee` makes her position instantly liquidatable)
- liquidates her position withdrawing the whole 0.5 DSU collateral

For the rest of the oracle version Alice has a 25 DSU position with 0 collateral. 
Which means that in the end of the period: 
- if positive Pnl: 
    Alice gets it added to her collateral, and can withdraw some gains
- if negative Pnl:
    It gets induced upon the protocol as shortfall:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/collateral/types/OptimisticLedger.sol#L62-L73

If Alice has multiple such positions on multiple accounts, considerable amounts can be stolen this way from the protocol.

## Impact
Alice obtains a riskless position, inducing potential shortfall on the protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not add positive Pnl to the collateral of an account if it does not have any collateral (to enforce the invariant: A position can not be without risk)
