# Markets products for an asset can have different oracles which can lead to liquidations of vault

## Summary
Ensuring that the long and short products of a market share the same oracle is critical for proper vault operations. However, the individual `updateOracle` functions could lead to unsynchronized version updates, resulting in unintended behavior for the vault. In a situation where significant asset price movements occur, this can potentially lead to liquidation and unpredictable withdrawal and deposit behaviors.
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon deployment, a vault is validated in its constructor to ensure that the long and short products of the market share the same oracle, which is necessary for proper operations. However, given that each product has an `updateOracle` function, there's a possibility that at some point in the future, one product could have a different oracle than the other. This divergence may cause the short and long products to update their versions independently, which is not an intended behavior for the vault.

Consider a scenario where the oracle for the short product updates an hour later than the long product. If the asset price takes a significant dip, the long product will update its version and report losses, even though the short product has yet to update its oracle version. In the event of a substantial price swing, the vault could face liquidation. Besides, withdrawals and deposits can also behave unpredictably as the vault's currentAssets will be skewed due to the unsynchronized updates between the long and short products.
## Impact
Since the products have functionality for updating the oracle this scenario is likely to be happening. Vault should also check in execution whether the oracles are same or not. Currently vault only checks if the oracles of same assets products are same but it can be updated and vault is not adjusted for that.

one accumulated the other is not, the problematic part where it can report losses 
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe introduce a public function called `syncOracles` where it can check the oracles of the same markets products and if they are not same vault can enter a state that the vault knows the oracles are different
