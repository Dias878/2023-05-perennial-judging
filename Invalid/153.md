# XO-The `onlyCollateral` modifier does not check to see if the `controller().collateral()` function returns a valid address.

## Summary
- The `onlyCollateral` modifier does not check to see if the `controller().collateral()` function returns a valid address. This means that an attacker can call the `onlyCollateral` modifier with a contract address that is not the collateral contract. 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
modifier onlyCollateral {
        if (msg.sender != address(controller().collateral())) revert NotCollateralError();

        _;
    }
```
- There is a vulnerability in the `controller()` function, the problem is in the  the `onlyCollateral` modifier,  it does not check to see if the `controller().collateral()` function returns a valid address. This means that an attacker could call the `onlyCollateral` modifier with a contract address that is not the `collateral` contract, and the modifier would not do anything. This could allow an attacker to bypass the modifier and call the function that is protected by the modifier.
## Impact
- An attacker can  bypass the modifier and call the function that is protected by the modifier and this lead to steal funds from the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add the check `require(controller().collateral() != address(0));` to the `onlyCollateral` modifier.
