# XO- `unsafeDiv` Function Allows `Exploitation` and `Unintended Code Execution`

## Summary
- the vulnerability is in the `unsafeDiv` function, where it can perform a division by zero if the input variable a is zero. The vulnerability arises from the if statement, which checks if `b` is zero using the `isZero` function but fails to check if `a` is zero. an attacker can  exploited this and cause  data loss and financial loss.
## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
function unsafeDiv(UFixed6 a, UFixed6 b) internal pure returns (UFixed6) {
        if (isZero(b)) {
            return isZero(a) ? ONE : MAX;
        } else {
            return div(a, b);
        }
    }
```
- there is a vulnerability present in the  the `if` statement. The `isZero` function returns true if `b` is zero, the if statement only checks if `isZero(b)` is true. It does not check if `isZero(a)` is true. This means that if `a` is zero, the function will divide by zero, which will cause an exception.
## Impact
- this can be exploited by an attacker and  lead to data loss, financial loss, and other damage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- modify the `if` statement to include a check for both `a` and `b` being zero. By ensuring that neither `a` nor `b` are zero.
