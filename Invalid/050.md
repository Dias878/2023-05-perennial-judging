# Possible overflow in Fixed18Lib.mul() function

## Summary

The mul() function in Fixed18Lib may not handle overflow conditions correctly. This could result in incorrect mathematical results which can be exploited.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Fixed18Lib library, the `mul()` function does not perform an overflow check. This function multiplies two Fixed18 values and then divides the result by the BASE value (1e18). If the product of the two values is larger than the maximum value that an int256 can hold, this will result in an overflow.

```solidity
function mul(Fixed18 a, Fixed18 b) internal pure returns (Fixed18) {
    return Fixed18.wrap(Fixed18.unwrap(a) * Fixed18.unwrap(b) / BASE);
}
```

## Impact

If an overflow occurs, it will cause incorrect mathematical calculations and could potentially be exploited by a malicious user to manipulate contract state in unintended ways. This could result in loss of funds or other detrimental outcomes depending on how the function is used in the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Fixed18Lib.sol
function mul(Fixed18 a, Fixed18 b) internal pure returns (Fixed18) {
    return Fixed18.wrap(Fixed18.unwrap(a) * Fixed18.unwrap(b) / BASE);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a check to prevent overflow conditions. You can make use of the OpenZeppelin SafeMath library which provides functions for safe multiplication that throw an exception on overflow. 

## Proof Of Concept

1. Create an instance of a contract that uses the Fixed18Lib library.
2. Call the `mul()` function with two very large Fixed18 values such that their product would exceed the maximum value of an int256.
3. Observe that the function does not revert and instead returns an incorrect result.
