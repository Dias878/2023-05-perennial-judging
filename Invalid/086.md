# Token libraries are missing increase/decrease allowance methods

## Summary
The token libraries - Token6, Token18, and TokenOrEther18 - currently lack functionality for adjusting allowance methods, affecting their overall performance. Implementing methods for increasing and decreasing allowances will greatly enhance their functionality, ensuring they operate as intended.
## Vulnerability Detail
Existing token libraries, namely Token6, Token18, and TokenOrEther18, currently only support infinite approval and safeApprove methods. However, as the safeApprove method's natspec indicates, this method does not function as expected when changing allowances from one non-zero value to another. As a result, the libraries are missing functionality for increasing and decreasing allowance methods. This limitation means that these libraries are not performing optimally as designed.
## Impact
Not sure how these libraries supposed to work but I think they must have these methods to be more compatible/flexible
