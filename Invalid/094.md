# XO- vulnerability in the `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` Incompatible with other chains

## Summary
- The vulnerability is that the `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` contract, which is specific to the Optimism `L2-side`. This means that the` UCrossChainOwner_Optimism` contract is not compatible with other chains, such as `Ethereum Mainnet`.
## Vulnerability Detail
 ```solidity
*      See {UCrossChainOwner} for initialization and usage.
 */
contract UCrossChainOwner_Optimism is UCrossChainOwner, UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism { }
```
- The problem  is that it inherits from the` UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` contract, which is specific to the` Optimism L2-side.` This means that the `UCrossChainOwner_Optimism` contract is not compatible with other `chains`,  as `Ethereum Mainnet`. this vulnerability  could be exploited by an attacker to gain control of the `UCrossChainOwner_Optimism` contract and its assets. For example, the attacker could create a malicious contract that inherits from the `UCrossChainOwner_Optimism` contract and then deploy it to `Ethereum Mainnet`. Once the malicious contract is deployed, the attacker could then use it to take control of the `UCrossChainOwner_Optimism` contract and its assets.
## Impact
- The vulnerability could cause unexpected behavior for users of the contract, make it difficult to update or maintain the contract can exploited by an attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- removing the inheritance from the `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` contract. This will make the `UCrossChainOwner_Optimism` contract `compatible` with all chains, not just `Optimism L2`.
