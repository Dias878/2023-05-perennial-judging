# Vault is not accounting the makerFee on product when minting shares for users

## Summary
Due to the negligence of the makerFee during the minting process after a user deposit, users obtain a larger share than the actual collateral they've provided to the vault.
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon a user depositing assets into the vault, the deposit incrementally increases the vault's total holdings. The immediate subsequent rebalancing will deploy the user's fresh deposit into the markets and mint the user's share in the next epoch. However, during the minting process, the makerFee isn't considered for the user, which results in the user acquiring a larger share than corresponds to the actual collateral they provided to the vault. Here is a representative scenario:

Consider that both short and long products have a 0.5% makerFee. Suppose that the vault possesses a balance of 10,000 units in collateral and a position on short and long products, with the token's price conveniently set to $1 for simplicity. Now, imagine that Alice deposits 1,000 DSU into the vault while it is synchronized (same version as the products). Her deposit increases the "_deposits" to 1,000, and "_deposits[Alice]" also becomes 1,000. Alice's deposit will increase the collateral to 10,497.5 for both long and short products, due to the application of maker fee on Alice's deposit. Hence, instead of 10,500, the total is 10,497.5 (5248.75 for each product).

At the start of the new epoch, let's assume no change in price or accrued funding for simplicity. In this scenario, Alice's shares will be calculated as 1,000 * 10,000 / 10,000 = 1,000. These shares will be minted for her. However, the reality is that Alice only contributed 999.5 units of collateral to the vault, so the accurate calculation should have been 999.5 * 10,000 / 10,000 = 999.5. This discrepancy arises because the makerFee is overlooked, meaning the user always obtains a higher share, as if no makerFees existed.
## Impact
Unfair share minting for vault users especially when makerFee in products are different for some vault depositors at the time of depositing.

Account the makerFee from the users deposit amount to the vault.
