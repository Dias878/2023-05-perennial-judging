# updatePendingOwner() is Front-Runnable

## Summary
The function  updatePendingOwner
```solidity
function updatePendingOwner(address newPendingOwner) public onlyOwner {
        _pendingOwner.store(newPendingOwner);
        emit PendingOwnerUpdated(newPendingOwner);
  }
```
 is onlyOwner,which means that it can only be called by the current owner of the contract. However, the function does not have any checks to prevent an attacker from front-running the transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
To front-run the transaction, an attacker would first need to find out the address of the current owner of the contract. Once they have the address, they can then submit a transaction to change the pending owner to their own address. If the attacker's transaction has a higher gas price than the transaction that is submitted by the current owner, then the attacker's transaction will be processed first. This means that the attacker will be able to change the pending owner to their own address before the current owner has a chance to execute the updatePendingOwner() function.

## Impact
Once the attacker has changed the pending owner to their own address, they can then execute the acceptOwner() function. This will make them the new owner of the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would recommend using a service like Chainlink Keepers to schedule the updatePendingOwner() function to be executed at a later time. This will prevent an attacker from front-running the transaction.
