# Balanced vault with zero weighted market sees funds definitely bricked

## Summary
If a user creates a balanced vault with a zero weighted market, all funds deposited to this vault will be unredeemable (bricked definitively).

## Vulnerability Detail
To determine how much of shares it is possible to redeem from a vault, the following function is used:

However we can see that this statement:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L673

will revert if the weight of a market is zero.

Deposit will function normally, however no funds will be deployed to underlying markets due to this conditions in rebalanceCollateral/rebalancePosition respectively:

## Impact
A vault is created, and can accept deposits normally, however all funds deposited are definitely bricked
