# Perennial (Incentivizer) Reward Token open to decimal issue

## Summary

Perennial (Incentivizer) Reward Token open to decimal issue

## Vulnerability Detail

The Perennial reward token documentation mentions that it doesn't support non-standard ERC20 fee-on-transfer and rebase tokens. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether it only supports 18 decimal token precision. (This reward token is different from Collateral token, which is USDC / DSU).

```js
File: ProgramInfo.sol
10: struct ProgramInfo {
...
14:     /// @dev Amount of total maker and taker rewards
15:     Position amount;
...
23:     /**
24:      * @dev Reward ERC20 token contract
25:      * @notice Perennial does not support non-standard ERC20s as reward tokens for incentive programs, including,
26:                 but not limited to: fee on transfer and rebase tokens. Using such a non-standard token will likely
27:                 result in loss of funds.
28:      */
29:     Token18 token;
30: }
```

The amount of rewards also measured in `Position`, which is an `UFixed18` amount for maker and taker.

```js
File: Position.sol
12: struct Position {
13:     /// @dev Quantity of the maker position
14:     UFixed18 maker;
15:     /// @dev Quantity of the taker position
16:     UFixed18 taker;
17: }
```

Both token and amount of Incentive reward is stated 18 decimals. Issue arise when Product owner or Program Manager using a token with decimal not 18, like USDC (6 decimal).

for example, when creating a program, by calling `Incentivizer:create()`, and its part of code:

```js
File: Incentivizer.sol
56:         // Take fee
57:         UFixed18 programTotal = programInfo.amount.sum();
58:         UFixed18 programFeeAmount = programInfo.deductFee(_controller.incentivizationFee());
59:         fees[programInfo.token] = fees[programInfo.token].add(programFeeAmount);
60:
...
64:         // Charge creator
65:         programInfo.token.pull(msg.sender, programTotal);
```

This `programTotal` will sum up (maker & taker) amount with 18 decimal precision, at the end to charge creator, it will `pull` (line 65) (transfer in) the reward token with 18 decimal precision, even though it's a 6 decimal token. USDC with its 6 decimal token is a common stable coin which is being used widely, so assuming the reward token would be supporting USDC is an acceptable one.

Decimal precision is crucial when working with tokens, as it determines the level of granularity for representing fractional amounts. In this case, if the Perennial Reward token lacks proper decimal handling, it may result in incorrect reward calculations.

## Impact

Lost decimal precision in reward token may result in incorrect reward calculations

## Recommendation

Do not expect every Reward token would be a 18 decimal token (UFixed18). Provide a flexible approach to handle reward tokens with varying decimal precision
