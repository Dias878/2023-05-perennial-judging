# ChainlinkRound: Incorrect phase IDs could be returned due to unsafe bitwise operation


## Summary

This report is centered on a vulnerability discovered in the `phaseId` function of the `ChainlinkRoundLib` library. The bitwise shift operation being done unsafely could lead to incorrect phase IDs being returned when handling `roundId` values less than `2^64`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `phaseId` function in the `ChainlinkRoundLib` library is designed to extract the phase ID from a given round by shifting the round ID 64 bits to the right. However, there are no checks in place to ensure that the round ID is greater than or equal to `2^64`. Thus, if the function is supplied with a `roundId` value less than `2^64`, the shift operation will always result in 0, leading to an incorrect phase ID being returned.

Additionally, the return type of the `phaseId` function is `uint16`, hence the result of the bitwise shift operation is implicitly cast to `uint16`. If the actual phase ID after the shift operation is greater than the maximum `uint16` value, it will result in incorrect downcasting and thus an incorrect phase ID.

```solidity
function phaseId(ChainlinkRound memory self) internal pure returns (uint16) {
    return uint16(self.roundId >> PHASE_OFFSET); // PHASE_OFFSET = 64
}
```

### POC:

To demonstrate this bug, here is a minimalistic contract and a simple test in JavaScript using the Hardhat framework:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Staking {
    constructor() {}

    function getShiftedValue(uint256 x) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return x >> 64;
    }
}
```

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("Staking contract", function () {
  it("Should return incorrect value for inputs less than 2^64", async function () {
    const Staking = await ethers.getContractFactory("Staking");
    const staking = await Staking.deploy();
    await staking.deployed();

    let result = await staking.getShiftedValue(10);
    expect(result.toString()).to.equal("0"); // For all values less than 2^64, it will return 0

    result = await staking.getShiftedValue("18446744073709551615"); // 2^64 - 1
    expect(result.toString()).to.equal("0"); // For all values less than 2^64, it will return 0

    result = await staking.getShiftedValue("18446744073709551616"); // 2^64
    expect(result.toString()).to.equal("1"); // This should return 1, but will return 0 for all values less than 2^64
  });
});
```

This test case will show that the `getShiftedValue` function will return `0` for all inputs less than `2^64`, even when it should return `1` for an input of `2^64`. It helps to demonstrate the incorrect behavior of the shift operation for inputs less than `2^64`.

Also other implemnetation of the `roundId` in other contracts suggest that this value could actually be smaller than uint64 since unsafe downcasting are done on the value of the roundID

## Impact

The main impact of this vulnerability is that it may lead to the incorrect processing of round data. This can have severe implications, particularly in scenarios where accurate phase ID values are critical for the correct execution of the smart contract. An incorrect phase ID can mislead the contract into operating on incorrect data or phases.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In order to fix this vulnerability, a check should be added to ensure that the `roundId` is greater than or equal to `2^64` before performing the shift operation. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to add additional checks to ensure that the phase ID after the shift operation is less than or equal to the maximum `uint16` value, in order to prevent incorrect downcasting.

If larger phase ID values are expected, consider changing the return type of the `phaseId` function to accommodate larger numbers. Always ensure the data types and operations used in your contract align with your specific use-case requirements and constraints.
