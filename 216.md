# Oracles may return stale prices

## Summary
Both oracles contracts (`ChainlinkOracle` and `ChainlinkFeedOracle`) can return stale prices because of the lack of checks for it. 

## Vulnerability Detail
After calling `latestRoundData` at the Chainlink oracles, both contracts make some checks to ensure the validity of the output:

```solidity
if (uint64(round.roundId) == 0 || round.timestamp == 0) revert InvalidOracleRound();
```

This is to ensure the roundId is valid but it forgets to check that the price is fresh and not stale. 

But the contract is forgetting to ensure that the answer given by the oracle is fresh, meaning the answer given hasn't been updated more than a certain time ago. For ETH/USD oracle, the heartbeat is of 3600 seconds, meaning the oracle must be updated at least every 1 hour.

It's a must to check that the answer given by the oracle (ETH/USD in our case) has been updated in the last hour, and no more.

## Impact
If the Chainlink oracle is returning stale prices, the protocol will make a version update with the wrong price so that will carry losses to the users in `Perennial`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to check the `updatedAt` value with the current `block.timestamp` to ensure that the time passed since that price was set is no more than `staleFeedThreshold` (the recommended for ETH/USD is 1 hour).

```solidity
if (block.timestamp - round.timestamp > staleFeedThreshold) revert();
```
