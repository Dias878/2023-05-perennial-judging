# Chainlink price feed is not validated in constructor

## Summary
Chainlink price feeds - including the roundId and timestamp - are verified during each product settlement, the current setup lacks this verification process during the initial deployment in the constructor.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Chainlink price feeds, which include roundId and timestamp, are verified each time the product settles. However, this verification process is not currently performed in the constructor upon initial deployment.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do the same check for constructor aswell, or make a generic internal function to validate the entire chainlink round parameters and call that in between functions
