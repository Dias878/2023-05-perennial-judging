# Malicious trader can intentionally generate small shortfall for a product

## Summary
An attacker can use auto-liquidation to cause small amounts of bad debt to the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an account has `minCollateral*liquidationFee` collateral, a liquidation brings the collateral left to exactly 0:

Only the position close is not yet settled, and will be settled at next oracle version. Which means that any negative pnl/funding/fees incurred by the position left at that version will be added to shortfall in the collateral. 

Alice can create a riskless bet this way:

Step 1: Bring the collateral on a position to the value `minCollateral*liquidationFee`:

Initial state the pool has `500 USD` total taker position and `1000 USD` total maker position
ETH priced at `2000 USD`
minCollateral = 10 DSU
liquidationFee = 10%, which means targetCollateral = 1 DSU.

with account 1:
    create taker position with collateral = `minCollateral`:

    `collateral = 10 DSU`

    with this colleteral the trader can open a `500 USD` worth taker position in the ETH market (maintenance at 2%).

with account 2:
    create maker position with collateral = 20 DSU;

    with this colleteral the trader can open a `1000 USD` worth maker position in the ETH market (maintenance at 2%).

Which is delta neutral since maker take the opposite side of takers proportionally. 

ETH price declines to 1955 USD, which brings collateral to 1 DSU on the taker position with a position value of 50 USD.

Step 2: Make the position liquidatable and auto-liquidate:

Wait for an oracle update decreasing the price of ETH, backrun the oracle update to auto-liquidate the taker position. Since collateral left in the position is `minCollateral*liquidationFee`, after liquidate is called all collateral is transfered to the liquidator.

Step 3: Settle closing position at version + 1:

When the previously closed position settles at version + 1, it's negative pnl will be incurred as shortfall on the product. 

## Impact
A malicious user can deliberately create (albeit small) shortfall for the protocol
