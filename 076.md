# A trader close to liquidation risks being liquidated by trying to reduce her position

## Summary
A trader close to liquidation risks being liquidated by trying to reduce her position

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see in the implementation of closeTake/closeMake that the `maintenanceInvariant` is not enforced:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/product/Product.sol#L246-L256

and the takerFee is deducted immediately from traders collateral, whereas the position reduction only takes effect at next settlement:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/product/Product.sol#L258-L273

This means that a legitimate user close to liquidation, who may want to reduce leverage by closing position will end up immediately liquidatable.

Example:
>Maintenance factor is 2%
>Liquidation fee is 5%
>Taker fee is 0.1%
>Funding fee is 0%

Alice has a 50x leverage `taker` position opened as authorized per maintenance invariant:

Alice collateral: 100 DSU
Alice taker position: notional of 5000 DSU

Alice tries to reduce her position to a more reasonable 40x, calls `closeTake(1000)`. 
A 1 DSU taker fee is deducted immediately from her collateral. Since the reduction of the position only takes effect on next oracle version, her position becomes immediately liquidatable. 
A liquidator closes it entirely, making Alice lose an additional 4 DSU `takerFee` on next settlement and 250 DSU of liquidationFee.

## Impact
A user trying to avoid liquidation is liquidated unjustly

## Recommendation
Either:
- Do not deduce takerFee from collateral immediately, but at next settlement, as any other fees
or
- Enforce `maintenanceInvariant` on closing of positions, to make transaction revert (except when closing is liquidation already)
