# an account's deposit on BalancedVault can be DOS to delay permanently

## Summary
an account's deposit on BalancedVault can be DOS to delay permanently

## Vulnerability Detail
deposit on BalancedVault also follows the execute/settle pattern, where settlement is delayed to the next epoch to prevent MEV. However, the `deposit` function allows anyone to deposit for another account. Anyone can deposit dust for other in order to delay someone's previous deposit. 

```solidity
    function deposit(UFixed18 assets, address account) external {
        (EpochContext memory context, ) = _settle(account);
        if (assets.gt(_maxDepositAtEpoch(context))) revert BalancedVaultDepositLimitExceeded();

        if (currentEpochStale()) {
            _pendingDeposit = _pendingDeposit.add(assets);
            _pendingDeposits[account] = _pendingDeposits[account].add(assets);
            _pendingEpochs[account] = context.epoch + 1;
            emit Deposit(msg.sender, account, context.epoch + 1, assets);
        } else {
            _deposit = _deposit.add(assets);
            _deposits[account] = _deposits[account].add(assets);
            _latestEpochs[account] = context.epoch;
            emit Deposit(msg.sender, account, context.epoch, assets);
        }

        asset.pull(msg.sender, assets);

        _rebalance(context, UFixed18Lib.ZERO);
    }
```
## Impact
a deposit can be maliciously delayed until its settlement favours the attackers.
