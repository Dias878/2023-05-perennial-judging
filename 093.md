# XO-Lack of `Non-Zero` Validation in `UCrossChainOwner_Arbitrum` Contract

## Summary
- The `UCrossChainOwner_Arbitrum` contract does not check to make sure that the `owner` and `newOwner` variables are `non-zero` before assigning them. This means that an attacker could set these variables to zero, which would effectively give them `ownership` of the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
**
 * @title UCrossChainOwner_Arbitrum
 * @notice Contract to act as an owner of other contracts
 * @dev This contract is designed to act as an owner of any Ownable contract, allowing
 *      Cross Chain Ownership without modification to the underlying ownable contract. This contract
 *      is specific to the Arbitrum L2-side and should not be used on other chains.
 *
 *      See {UCrossChainOwner} for initialization and usage.
 */
contract UCrossChainOwner_Arbitrum is UCrossChainOwner, UCrossChainOwnable_Arbitrum { }
```
- The `UCrossChainOwner_Arbitrum` contract has `two` variables, `owner` and `newOwner`, which store the addresses of the current `owner` and the` new owner`, respectively. When the `transferOwnership()` function is called, the `newOwner` variable is assigned the address of the new `owner`, the contract does not check to make sure that the `newOwner` variable is `non-zero`. This means that an attacker could call the `transferOwnership()` function and pass in the address of a zero value. If the attacker does this, then the `newOwner` variable will be set to zero, which will effectively give the attacker ownership of the contract.

- Once the attacker has ownership of the contract, they can do anything they want with it. They could steal funds from the contract, modify the contract's code, or even delete the contract altogether.
## Impact
-  an attacker can set the `owner` and `newOwner` variables to zero.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  the` UCrossChainOwner_Arbitrum` contract should check to make sure that the `owner` and `newOwner` variables are non-zero before assigning them. This can be done by using the require() function
