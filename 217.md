# Loss of Precision when calculating `positionFee`

## Summary
When opening or closing a position, a `positionFee` is taken from the user's collateral but the fee is sometimes rounded down to zero if called with enough low values.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Product` contract, functions `openTakeFor`, `_closeTake`, `openMakeFor` and `_closeMake` make some calculations to get the `positionFee` that the user must pay for opening or closing positions. 

The calculations are equal in 4 functions, we'll take `openTakeFor` as an example:

```solidity
UFixed18 positionFee = amount.mul(latestOracleVersion.price.abs()).mul(takerFee());
```
This uses the `mul` function from `UFixed18` library:
```solidity
function mul(UFixed18 a, UFixed18 b) internal pure returns (UFixed18) {
    return UFixed18.wrap(UFixed18.unwrap(a) * UFixed18.unwrap(b) / BASE);
}
```

So the calculation of `positionFee` can be translated to the following expression:

```solidity
positionFee = amount * latestOracleVersion.price / 1e18 * takerFee / 1e18
```

As you can see, there's some division performed before the multiplication and that can carry precision loss.

In products that `latestOracleVersion.price` is a small number, when calling the function with an amount being low enough the user can avoid paying the position fee. 

Imagine the following scenario:
1. We have a product with a `latestOracleVersion.price` of `1e10` and a `takerFee` of `15e14` (0.0015 in ETH). 
2. A user wants to open a taker position of `1e18` but doesn't want to pay the fees.
3. Instead of calling `openTake` with an amount of `1e18` it calls `openTake` 100000000 times with a value of `1e10`.
4. Because of the precision loss, the position fee calculated will be zero so the user won't pay any fees. 

```solidity
positionFee = amount * latestOracleVersion.price / 1e18 * takerFee / 1e18
positionFee = 1e10 * 1e10 / 1e18 * 15e14 / 1e18
positionFee = 0
```

## Impact
Everyone can call the `openTakeFor`, `_closeTake`, `openMakeFor` and `_closeMake` functions and avoid paying any position fees. Later, when settling a new oracle version, position fees are going to be distributed to makers so it can cause protocol insolvency.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After the position fee calculation, it's recommended to check that if the set fee is not zero, the calculated fee must not be zero. 

Example solution with `openTakeFor`:
```diff
function openTakeFor(address account, UFixed18 amount)
    public
    nonReentrant
    notPaused
    notClosed
    onlyAccountOrMultiInvoker(account)
    settleForAccount(account)
    maxUtilizationInvariant
    positionInvariant(account)
    liquidationInvariant(account)
    maintenanceInvariant(account)
{
    // {...}

    UFixed18 positionFee = amount.mul(latestOracleVersion.price.abs()).mul(takerFee());
+   if(takerFee() != 0 && positionFee == 0) revert(); // @audit Sanity check to avoid precision loss

    // {...}
}
```
