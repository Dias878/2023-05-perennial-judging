# Missing Sequencer Uptime Feed check can cause unfair liquidations on Arbitrum

## Summary
When the Arbitrum sequencer is down and then comes back up, all Chainlink price updates will become available on Arbitrum within a very short time.

This leaves users no time to react to the price changes which can lead to unfair liquidations.

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink explains their Sequencer Uptime Feeds [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds).

Quoting from the documentation:
> To help your applications identify when the sequencer is unavailable, you can use a data feed that tracks the last known status of the sequencer at a given point in time. This helps you prevent mass liquidations by providing a grace period to allow customers to react to such an event.

Users are still able in principle to avoid liquidations by interacting with the Arbitrum delayed inbox via L1, but this is out of reach for most users.

## Impact
Users can get unfairly liquidated because they cannot react to price movements when the sequencer is down and when the sequencer comes back up, all price updates will immediately become available.

## Code Snippet
This issue can be observed in both the `ChainlinkOracle` and `ChainlinkFeedOracle`, which do not make use of the sequencer uptime feed to check the status of the sequencer:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The Chainlink documentation contains an example for how to check the sequencer status: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds

There can be a grace period when the sequencer comes back up for users to act on their collateral (increase collateral to avoid liquidation).
