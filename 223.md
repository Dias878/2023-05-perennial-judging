# When Product is closed, then liquidation is not allowed

## Summary
When Product is closed, then liquidation is not allowed. Positions that will be underwater will not be closed by their owners which will make losses for another traders.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Product` contract [can be closed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/product/Product.sol#L510-L514) by the coordinator. When this is done, then the only option that is enabled to users is to close their positions, because everything else uses `notClosed` modifier.

What we need to check is that `closeAll` function also [can't be called when product is closed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/product/Product.sol#L362). This function is used by `Collateral` contract [in order to liquidate account](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/collateral/Collateral.sol#L123).

That means that once product will be closed, then liquidations will not be allowed as well.
However it's not guaranteed that user's will close their positions immediately, so they can become underwater and no one will liquidate them.
## Impact
Underwater positions can't be liquidated

## Recommendation
Allow liquidation after closing product, as liquidation closes position as well.
