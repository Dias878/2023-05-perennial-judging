# XO- Unvalide `constructor` parameter in `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` contract

## Summary
- The vulnerability in the `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` contract has a constructor that takes a single parameter, `l2CrossDomainMessengerAddress`. This parameter is passed in `dynamically` so An attacker can control the `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` contract by passing in a malicious address to the constructor. This could have a number of `negative` consequences, such as stealing funds or preventing users from accessing their funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
abstract contract UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism is CrossChainEnabledOptimism, UCrossChainOwnable {
    /// @dev System address for the CrossDomainMessenger. This address is ONLY valid on the L2 side
    address public constant L2_CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSENGER_ADDRESS = address(0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000007);

    constructor() CrossChainEnabledOptimism(L2_CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSENGER_ADDRESS) {}
}
```
- The `constructor()` function for the `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` contract calls the `CrossChainEnabledOptimism` constructor, which takes a single parameter, `l2CrossDomainMessengerAddress`. This parameter is passed in` dynamically`, but the `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` constructor does not check to make sure that the parameter is `valid`. This means that an attacker could pass in a malicious address, which could then be used to control the `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` contract.
## Impact
-  an attacker to control the `UCrossChainOwnable_Optimism` contract, which could have a number of negative consequences as stealing funds or preventing users from accessing their funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The `constructor()` function should check to make sure that the `l2CrossDomainMessenger` Address parameter is `valid`. This can be done by using the `address.isContract()` function to check if the address is a valid contract address.
- The `setL2CrossDomainMessengerAddress()` function should `require` that the new address is a valid contract address. This can be done by using the `require()` function.
