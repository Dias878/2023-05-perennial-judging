```solidity
     */
    function claim(address account) external {
        (EpochContext memory context, ) = _settle(account);

        UFixed18 unclaimedAmount = _unclaimed[account];
        UFixed18 unclaimedTotal = _totalUnclaimed;
        _unclaimed[account] = UFixed18Lib.ZERO;
        _totalUnclaimed = unclaimedTotal.sub(unclaimedAmount);
        emit Claim(msg.sender, account, unclaimedAmount);

        // pro-rate if vault has less collateral than unclaimed
        UFixed18 claimAmount = unclaimedAmount;
        UFixed18 totalCollateral = _assets();
        if (totalCollateral.lt(unclaimedTotal)) claimAmount = claimAmount.muldiv(totalCollateral, unclaimedTotal);

        _rebalance(context, claimAmount);

        asset.push(account, claimAmount);
    }
```

In case, when asset balance is less than `unclaimedTotal`, then users will receive less amount.
`if (totalCollateral.lt(unclaimedTotal)) claimAmount = claimAmount.muldiv(totalCollateral, unclaimedTotal);`

`totalCollateral` is not stale value as it's changing with every position closing and settlement. As such it's possible that sometimes `totalCollateral` can become less than `unclaimedTotal` and then in some time become bigger again.

Malicious user can wait for such events in order to claim less amount to the claimers, who didn't claim yet.
As result of this he can increase amount per share for the users who still in the vault and make losses for users, that are now claimed by him.
## Impact
User;s account can be claimed not in the best time and make losses.
