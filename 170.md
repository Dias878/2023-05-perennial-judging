# A malicious user can create a maker position to imbalance vault

## Summary
A malicious user can create a maker position to prevent vault from correctly rebalancing 

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that during rebalancing, the balanced vault handles the `makerLimit()` gracefully by creating the biggest maker position possible on any product:

However, any user can take advantage of this:
before a deposit (when the vault should increase exposure to underlying markets), take a maker position on an underlying market to push maker available to zero (position.maker === makerLimit).

Example:

BalancedVault balances maker positions between products short ETH and long ETH 50/50.

Alice wants to deposit 10000 DSU into the vault, but Bob seeing this front runs the transaction with creating a maker position topping up the long market to the `makerLimit`.

After rebalancing, Alice has an exposure of 5000 DSU to short ETH, and can lose money as is not delta neutral as expected.

## Impact
A balanced vault can be easily imbalanced during deposits, and users are unexpectedly exposed to one leg of a market.

## Recommendation
Maybe one can emulate the same mechanism as during withdrawal:

Where the deposit is capped by makerLimit of each product in every market
