# Wrong implementation in `_providerContract()`

## Summary
`_providerContract()` seems to be implemented wrongly. As a result, `payoffType == CONTRACT` cannot be used.

## Vulnerability Detail

`self.data` is left shifted by 80 bits and then casted to bytes20 to recover the provider contract's address. This computation however, will never be able to return a valid ethereum address as the least significant 10 bits of the results will always be 0 regardless of the value of `self.data`. Since `self.data` is 30 bytes, I suppose `self.data` is meant to store the provider contract's address in the first 20 bytes, and 10 bytes of other data in the last 10 bytes.

```solidity
  function _providerContract(
    PayoffDefinition memory self
  ) private pure returns (IContractPayoffProvider) {
    if (self.payoffType != PayoffType.CONTRACT) revert PayoffDefinitionNotContract(self.payoffType, self.data);
    // Shift to pull the last 20 bytes, then cast to an address
    return IContractPayoffProvider(address(bytes20(self.data << 80)));
  }

```

## Impact
`payoffType == CONTRACT` cannot be used as price transformation is derived from `_providerContract()`, but is currently returning an incorrect address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should shift to the right instead.

```solidity
  function _providerContract(
    PayoffDefinition memory self
  ) private pure returns (IContractPayoffProvider) {
    if (self.payoffType != PayoffType.CONTRACT) revert PayoffDefinitionNotContract(self.payoffType, self.data);
    // Shift to pull the last 20 bytes, then cast to an address
-   return IContractPayoffProvider(address(bytes20(self.data << 80)));
+   return IContractPayoffProvider(address(bytes20(self.data >> 80)));
  }

```
