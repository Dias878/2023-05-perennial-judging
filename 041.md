# If long and short products has different maker fees, vault rebalance can be spammed to eat vaults balance

## Summary
In a market scenario where long and short products carry different position fees, continuous rebalancing could potentially deplete the vault's funds. This situation arises when closing positions incurs a maker fee, which gradually eats away at the collateral balance. The rebalancing cycle continues until the fee becomes insignificant or the collateral balance is exhausted.
## Vulnerability Detail
If a market's long and short products have different position fees, continuous rebalancing could be an issue. A significant position fee difference might deplete all funds after repeated rebalancing.

Let's consider a scenario. Suppose there's a market where the long product has a 0% maker fee (position fee), and the short product has a 5% maker fee. Imagine a vault that has 100 positions spread across these markets: 25 short positions and 75 long positions, with collateral balances of 25-75 on each.

Now let's say the vault and the product are fully synced (i.e., of the same version). When someone invokes syncAccount(address(0)), the syncAccount function initially calls 'settle.' If we are in the same epoch, 'settle' isn't critical. However, rebalancing presents a challenge.

Firstly, collateral is rebalanced: 25 collateral units are redeemed from the long market and deposited in the short market, making the collateral balances 50-50. Then, positions are adjusted. The short market needs an extra 25 positions, and the long market needs 25 fewer. When the long market closes 25 positions, the vault's collateral balance and long position balance become 50. Yet, when we open 25 positions in the short market, the collateral balance decreases due to the maker fee.

Assuming a 10% maker fee, increasing the short position by 25 (to 50) will reduce the collateral balance by 2.5 due to the maker fee. Thus, we end with:

Short Market: 47.5 collateral balance, 50 positions
Long Market: 50 collateral balance, 50 positions
Given the unequal collateral balances, we can rebalance again. This means we need to redeem 1.25 from the long market and add it to the short market. As prices are unchanged from the last rebalancing, the target market position will be (48.75 + 48.75) / 2 = 48.75 for both markets. We'll close 1.25 positions from both markets, leading to 48.75 positions each. But closing 1.25 positions in the short market incurs the maker fee again, reducing the collateral balance by 0.125.

This cycle can repeat until the fee amount is trivial enough to round down to zero. However, if the amounts are larger, repeatedly calling syncAccount will slowly erode the vault's collateral balance by persistently paying the unnecessary fee.
## Impact
Since the vaults funds can be drained significantly if certain cases are met (high makerFee set by market owner and big price movements leading to different collateral balances between markets). I'll label it as high.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider accounting the positionFee if there are any on any of the markets or assert that both of the markets has the same positionFee.
