# XO-`acceptOwner()` function can be called by `unauthorized` users

## Summary
- The vulnerability is in the  `acceptOwner()` function, it's can be called by `unauthorized` users. This is because the function does not check to see if the `sender` of the transaction is the `pending` owner. This allows an attacker to call the function and `take control` of the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
```SOLIDITY
*/
    function acceptOwner() public {
        _beforeAcceptOwner();

        if (_sender() != pendingOwner()) revert UOwnableNotPendingOwnerError(_sender());

        _updateOwner(pendingOwner());
        updatePendingOwner(address(0));
    }
```
- There is a vulnerability in the acceptOwner() function, especially in the 
`if (_sender() != pendingOwner()) revert UOwnableNotPendingOwnerError(_sender());`, this line of code checks to see if the `sender` of the `transaction`  is the pending `owner`. If the `sender` is `not` the pending owner, the transaction `reverts`. so the problem with that line is that it can be `bypassed` by an attacker.
An attacker can create a malicious transaction that calls the `acceptOwner()` function with the attacker's address as the pending owner. If the transaction is successful, the attacker will become the owner of the contract and could then do anything that the owner can do, such as withdraw funds from the contract or change the contract's code

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- add this `require(_sender() == pendingOwner());` this will ensure that the `acceptOwner()` function can only be called by the pending `owner`.
