# Unsafe downcasting in ChainlinkAggregator and all other Chainlink-prefixed contracts


## Summary

Integer overflow vulnerability could happen due to unsafe type casting operations. This is seen in multiple instances in the ChainlinkAggregator.sol contract where `uint256` is unsafely cast to `uint80`, leading to possible overflow errors and erroneous data retrieval.

NB: This report only covers the instance in `getRound` and `_search` though issue exist in `_tryGetProxyRoundData` in the same ChainlinkAggregator.sol contract and multiple instances in other Chainlink-prefixed contracts

## Vulnerability Detail

The unsafe type casting is found in two functions: `getRound` and `_search`. In both instances, a `uint256` type variable is converted to a `uint80` type. If the `uint256` value is greater than the maximum `uint80` value (`2^80-1`), this would result in an integer overflow, effectively causing the value to wrap around to a much smaller, incorrect value.

This can cause critical issues as these functions are fetching data based on round Ids. An overflow could lead to data being fetched for incorrect round Ids, potentially causing the contract to return incorrect or unexpected values.

## Impact

Integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. If the overflow occurs when fetching round data, it can lead to incorrect data being retrieved and used. This can impact the contract's normal functioning and could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate or disrupt the contract's operations.

In the [getRound()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/0f73469508a4cd3d90b382eac2112f012a5a9852/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L44-L48) function, a `uint256` `roundId` is converted to `uint80` when calling the `getRoundData` method:

```solidity
function getRound(ChainlinkAggregator self, uint256 roundId) internal view returns (ChainlinkRound memory) {
    (, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) =
        AggregatorProxyInterface(ChainlinkAggregator.unwrap(self)).getRoundData(uint80(roundId));
    return ChainlinkRound({roundId: roundId, timestamp: updatedAt, answer: answer});
}
```

In the [\_search](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/0f73469508a4cd3d90b382eac2112f012a5a9852/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L123-L156) function, a similar conversion takes place:

```solidity
function _search(AggregatorProxyInterface proxy, uint16 phaseId, uint256 targetTimestamp, uint256 minTimestamp, uint256 minRoundId) private view returns (uint256) {
    // ... some code skipped ...
    uint256 midRound = Math.average(minRoundId, maxRoundId);
    uint256 midTimestamp = _tryGetProxyRoundData(proxy, phaseId, uint80(midRound));
    // ... some code skipped ...
}
```

In both these cases, if the value is too large to be represented as `uint80`, the conversion will result in an overflow, leading to an incorrect round Id.

NB: One could argue that roundId shouldn't be that big but the instance below from the [ChainlinkRound.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/0f73469508a4cd3d90b382eac2112f012a5a9852/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkRound.sol#L27-L29) contracts suggests otherwise, since roundId should be bigger than uint64 for the bitwise operation to execute error-free which implies that then can aswell be bigger than uint80 in _edge_ cases which validates the problems explained above

```solidity
    function phaseId(ChainlinkRound memory self) internal pure returns (uint16) {
        return uint16(self.roundId >> PHASE_OFFSET);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Code Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement checks before each conversion to ensure that the `uint256` value is within the valid range for a `uint80`. Here's an example of such a safety check:

```solidity
require(roundId <= type(uint80).max, "RoundId overflow");
```

This line should be added before each conversion in both `getRound` and `_search` functions. It will throw an exception if the roundId value is too large to be safely cast to `uint80`, thus preventing the overflow and ensuring data is fetched for the correct round.
