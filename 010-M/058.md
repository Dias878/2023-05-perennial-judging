# Differing maintenance leverages can risk immediate vault liquidation due to the inability to adjust target leverage

## Summary
Inconsistent maintenance across products in a market could necessitate adjustments to maintain the vault's risk rate. However, the current inability of a vault to modify its target leverage poses significant risks. A scenario where the maintenance leverage is increased can bring the vault perilously close to the liquidation threshold, especially if the vault cannot adjust its target leverage in response. This situation exposes the vault to immediate liquidation during sharp price fluctuations or if maintenance leverage exceeds the actual leverage.
## Vulnerability Detail
In a market, if the products have differing maintenance leverages, these might need adjustment to keep the vault's risk rate in check. However, currently, the vault lacks the capability to alter its target leverage.

Let's consider a situation where the vault has equal collateral balances of 100 and positions of 500 on both sides, operating at 5x leverage (the positions are worth $500 each). If the maintenance is set at 5% for both markets and the asset price is $1, the vault remains secure as long as the product's notional value multiplied by the maintenance is less than the collateral.

However, the market owner has the discretion to change the maintenance, which could necessitate the vault adjusting its leverage to continue operating safely. Suppose the short market increases its maintenance to 20%. Based on the current figures, the short market is perilously close to the liquidation threshold (500 * 20% = 100), necessitating an immediate reduction in the target leverage variable.

The vault currently lacks this functionality. Consequently, if sharp price movements occur or if the maintenance is increased beyond the leverage, the vault will be immediately subject to liquidation.
## Impact
Since the products are controlled by product coordinators, this scenario can happen likely. Product owner might need or want to increase the maintenance level for its product to maintain the safety of product and the product owner should not be thinking whether that update would affect the vault or not since the product is a separate system than the vault.
