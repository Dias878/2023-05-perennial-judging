# Chainlink phase transmissions can be flawed

## Summary
There is a flaw in the phase detection process of the Chainlink price query that might lead to incorrect handling and storage of new phases. This issue could result in errors when querying versions that should belong to the previous phase, but are incorrectly associated with the new phase. This bug can cause the contract to attempt accessing non-existent roundIds, resulting in erroneous operations.
## Vulnerability Detail
There's an issue concerning the phase detection in the Chainlink price query where the contract may not accurately handle a new phase, causing it to be added to the phases array incorrectly. Let's run through a scenario to understand this better:

Suppose we have only one phase with the following attributes: starting version = 0, latestPhaseId = 3, latestPhaseStartingRoundId = 10, _lastSyncedRound = 30. Also, our product's latest sync version is 20 (because _lastSyncedRoundId = 30).

Let's also assume that the current Chainlink roundId is 35, indicating that our ChainlinkOracleFeed is outdated and needs to be synced.

Now, let's assume that the roundId 34 witnesses a change in the chainlink oracle's phaseId to 4. This suggests that roundId 34 belongs to phase 3, and phase 4 starts post roundId 34.

So when the sync() method in ChainlinkOracleFeed.sol is invoked, the latestRoundId retrieved is 35, and it's detected that a phase transmission has occurred.

During the execution of getPhaseSwitchoverData, the try statement sends _lastSyncedRoundId + 1, which equals 31 and is still in phase 3. Consequently, the returned values are phaseRoundCount = 22, next phase = 4, nextStartingRoundId = 35.

Once the next phase gets added to the contract's storage, we're left with a phase where startingVersion = 22 (22 + 0) and startingRoundId = 35.

However, this presents an issue. If the products or the vault need to compute the version at 22, 23, 24, they will call the atVersion(uint256 version) method in the oracle contract. Using 22, 23, 24 as inputs will result in the _versionToPhase while loop pointing the versions to the latest phase id, which is 4. But these versions should be queried from phaseId 3, not 4, since phase 4 commenced after the conclusion of roundId 34.

Even worse, if you pass 23 into the atVersion of the oracle contract, the phase will be computed as 4, and the versionToRoundId will be computed as 36 (35 + 23 - 22). However, as per our assumption, the latest chainlink roundId is 35, meaning roundId 36 does not exist. This leads to an error.

This will make the products revert consistently and crushes the entire vault and product contracts.
