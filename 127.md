# XO-`_search` function does not check for `minRoundId` being equal to `0`

## Summary
- The `_search` functio has a vulnerability that can lead to incorrect results. The  problem arises from the initialization of the `maxRoundId` variable, which is set as `minRoundId + 1000` without checking if `minRoundId` is equal to `0`. This can be exploited by an attacker to obtain incorrect price information for tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _search(AggregatorProxyInterface proxy, uint16 phaseId, uint256 targetTimestamp, uint256 minTimestamp, uint256 minRoundId) private view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 maxRoundId = minRoundId + 1000; // Start 1000 rounds away when searching for maximum
        uint256 maxTimestamp = _tryGetProxyRoundData(proxy, phaseId, uint80(maxRoundId));

        // Find the round bounds of the phase to perform the binary search
        while (maxTimestamp <= targetTimestamp) {
            minRoundId = maxRoundId;
            minTimestamp = maxTimestamp;
            maxRoundId = maxRoundId * 2; // Find bounds of phase by multiplying the max round by 2
            maxTimestamp = _tryGetProxyRoundData(proxy, phaseId, uint80(maxRoundId));
        }

        // Binary Search starts here. The algorithm calculates the middle round ID and finds it's timestamp
        // If the midtimestamp is greater than target, set max to mid and continue
        // If the midtimestamp is less than or equal to target, set min to mid and continue
        // Exit when min + 1 is equal to or greater than max (no rounds between them)
        while (minRoundId + 1 < maxRoundId) {
            uint256 midRound = Math.average(minRoundId, maxRoundId);
            uint256 midTimestamp = _tryGetProxyRoundData(proxy, phaseId, uint80(midRound));
            if (midTimestamp > targetTimestamp) {
                maxTimestamp = midTimestamp;
                maxRoundId = midRound;
            } else {
                minTimestamp = midTimestamp;
                minRoundId = midRound;
            }
        }

        // If the found timestamp is not greater than target timestamp or no max was found, then the desired round does
        // not exist in this phase
        if (maxTimestamp <= targetTimestamp || maxTimestamp == type(uint256).max) return 0;

        return _aggregatorRoundIdToProxyRoundId(phaseId, uint80(maxRoundId));
    }
```
- There is a vulnerability in the  `_search`  function. This function is used to find the round `ID` closest to but greater than `targetTimestamp` for the specified phase `ID`, the problem in this function is in the the `maxRoundId` variable is `initialized` to `minRoundId + 1000`, here there is no check to ensure that `minRoundId` is not equal to `0`. 
- This means that if `minRoundId` is equal to `0`, then `maxRoundId` will be equal to `1000`, which is outside of the bounds of the phase. This could lead to an attacker being able to exploit the bug to get an incorrect result,  for example, if the attacker wants to get an incorrect price for a token, they could set `targetTimestamp` to a value that is before the start of the phase. This would cause the `_search` function to return a round `ID` that is outside of the bounds of the phase. The attacker could then use this round `ID` to get an incorrect price for the `token`.
## Impact
- An attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability by manipulating the `targetTimestamp` to a value before the start of the phase. When the `_search` function is called, it will return a round `ID` that is beyond the actual bounds of the phase. By using this incorrect round `ID`, the attacker can obtain misleading price information for tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adds a check to ensure that `minRoundId` is not equal to `0` before calculating `maxRoundId` this will ensures that `maxRoundId` is always within the bounds of the phase.
