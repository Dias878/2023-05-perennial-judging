# Malicious trader can bypass utilization buffer

## Summary
A malicious trader can bypass the Utilisation buffer, and push utilisation to 1 on any product.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious trader can bypass the utilisation buffer by first opening a maker position, open taker position and close previous maker position.
The only constraint is that she has to use different accounts to open the maker positions and the taker positions. Indeed perennial doesn't allow to have maker and taker positions on a product simultaneously.

So here's a concrete example:
```
Let's say the state of product is 900 USDC on the maker side, 800 on the taker side, which respects the 10% utilization buffer.

Using account 1, Alice opens up a maker position for 100 USDC, bringing maker total to 1000 USDC.

Using account 2, Alice can open a taker position for 100 USDC, bringing taker to 900 USDC, which respects the 10% utilization buffer still.

Now using account 1 again, Alice can close her 100 USDC maker position and withdraw collateral, clearing account 1 on perennial completely.

This brings the utilization to 100%, since taker = maker = 900 USDC. 
```

This is allowed, since only `takerInvariant` is checked when closing a maker position, which enforces that utilization ratio is lower than or equal to 100%.

## Impact
Any trader can bring the utilization up to 100%, and

## Recommendation
If a safety buffer needs to be enforced for the utilisation of products, it needs to be enforced on closing make positions as well.
