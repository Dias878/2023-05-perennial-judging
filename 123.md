# Position fees will cause collateral balance of an account to go below `minCollateral`

## Summary
There is a minimum collateral that is set in the Controller contract. This disallows users from depositing collateral that would make collateral balance less than minimum Collateral, and prevents withdraws that would make the collateral balance less than minimum collateral.
This issue explains how an account can cause his collateral balance to go below the minCollateral and even open positions with it, hence defeating the purpose of minCollateral

## Vulnerability Detail
Opening a position debits a takerFee or makerFee, depending on the position opened, from the collateral balance, and then checks if the collateral will be enough after the next settlement.
The problem is that the functions do not check if the collateral balance, after deducting the fees, is more than minCollateral. This would allow the following:
- User deposits collateral that is just a little above minCollateral
- User opens and closes positions, so position fees makes the balance less than minCollateral
- User repeats above step till his balance reaches the point when liquidators pay a higher gas fee than the liquidation fee he would receive
- User opens a risky position, but liquidators will be dissuaded from liquidating it

One of the purposes of minCollateral is to allow for gas costs that would cover liquidation.
- User can calculate a collateral balance(liquidationBalance) that would be less than gas costs on ethereum to dissuade liquidators from liquidating his account even when his collateral balance is well below the required maintenance.
- User would then open and close a position that would make his collateral balance liquidationBalance after fees are deducted
- User would open positions using liquidationBalance as collateral, and be rest assured that liquidators won't want to liquidate his account.

## Impact
A user can cause his collateral balance to be any value, even below minCollateral. With this power, he can make his collateral balance such that there would be no incentive to liquidate it.
Now, even when massive changes in Product's token price causes his collateral balance to be far less than the maintenance required, User's account may not be liquidated as there are no incentives for doing so.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Allow liquidation of an account whose collateral balance has fallen below minCollateral.(This would take care of instances when fundingFees causes the collateral balance to fall below minCollateral)
- Alternatively, Create a modifier in openMake and openTake founctions that ensures that after debiting the open+close position fees, the collateral balance does not fall below minCollateral
