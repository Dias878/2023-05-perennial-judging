# Liquidations can be done in an unsafe way putting product at risk

## Summary
When an account is being liquidated, all account positions including pre-positions will be closed. There is insufficient check in `closeAll()` to make sure liquidation wouldn't open up more risks for the product than prior liquidation.
## Vulnerability Detail
Under normal circumstance, when a user close a maker position, `takerInvariant()` is checked, to ensure there are enough maker quantities after position closing. 
```solidity
//Product.sol
    function closeMakeFor(address account, UFixed18 amount)
        public
        nonReentrant
        notPaused
        onlyAccountOrMultiInvoker(account)
        settleForAccount(account)
|>        takerInvariant
        closeInvariant(account)
        liquidationInvariant(account)
    {
        _closeMake(account, amount);
    }

```
```solidity
//Product.sol
    modifier takerInvariant() {
        _;

        if (closed()) return;

        Position memory next = positionAtVersion(latestVersion()).next(_position.pre);
        UFixed18 socializationFactor = next.socializationFactor();

        if (socializationFactor.lt(UFixed18Lib.ONE)) revert ProductInsufficientLiquidityError(socializationFactor);
    }

```
However, during liquidation, all user taker and maker positions are closed indiscriminately. And `takerInvariant()` is not used. 
```solidity
//Product.sol
    function closeAll(address account) external onlyCollateral notClosed settleForAccount(account) {
        AccountPosition storage accountPosition = _positions[account];
        Position memory p = accountPosition.position.next(_positions[account].pre);
        // Close all positions
        _closeMake(account, p.maker);
        _closeTake(account, p.taker);
        accountPosition.liquidation = true;
    }
```
In `_closeMake()` and `_closeTake()`, account positions are going to be directly closed without further checking. This might result in over closing of maker positions resulting in the product being in an unhealthy liquidity state taker>maker.
## Impact
The liquidity safety check is not enforced in `closeAll()`. This is more damaging when a whale maker's positions are closed as a result of the liquidation, potentially pushing the product into an extremely unbalanced liquidity state. 

I think this is a high severity because such unsafe liquidations can happen quite often across products.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of closing all user positions during liquidation in `closeAll`, allow user positions to be partially closed when there won't be enough liquidity in the product after position closing.
