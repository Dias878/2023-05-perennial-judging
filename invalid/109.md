# XO- `accumulate` function can crash if utilization ratio is greater than 1.0

## Summary
- The vulnerability is present in the `accumulate()` function of the `JumpRateUtilizationCurve18Lib` library. The function is responsible for calculating the interest earned on a loan based on the utilization ratio, time period, and notional amount. this vulnerability can exploit by an attacker and lead to crash the contract and lead to  financial losses for users.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function accumulate(
        JumpRateUtilizationCurve18 memory self,
        UFixed18 utilization,
        uint256 fromTimestamp,
        uint256 toTimestamp,
        UFixed18 notional
    ) internal pure returns (Fixed18) {
        return compute(self, utilization)
            .mul(Fixed18Lib.from(int256(toTimestamp - fromTimestamp)))
            .mul(Fixed18Lib.from(notional))
            .div(Fixed18Lib.from(365 days));
    }
}
```
- The vulnerability in the `accumulate()` function. so to be clear this function is used to calculate the interest earned on a loan. so the problem in the `accumulate()` function does not take into account the fact that the utilization ratio can be greater than `1.0`. This can happen if a user borrows more `USDC` than they have` collateralized`. If the utilization ratio is greater than `1.0`, then the `accumulate()` function will divide by `0`, this problem will cause the contract to crash. and can result in financial losses for users, as they may lose their collateral or be unable to repay their loans.
## Impact
- The vulnerability can cause the contract to crash, which can result in financial losses for users. It is important to fix this vulnerability,

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `accumulate()` function should be updated to check if the `utilization` ratio is greater than `1.0`. If the `utilization` ratio is greater than `1.0`, then the `accumulate()` function should return `0`.
