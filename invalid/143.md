# ProductManager.syncAccount may cause new user to revert in some cases

## Summary

A product coordinator can create an incentive program for his own product via `Incentivizer.create`. **One ProductManager per product**. The `programInfos` array in the `ProductManager` structure stores all static programs that have been created. **As time goes by, there are more and more incentive programs for the product, and this array will become larger and larger. Because useless incentive programs will not be deleted**. The `nextProgramFor` mapping in the `ProductManager` structure is used to record the next program to watch for for each user. The purpose of this is to prevent traversing the `programInfos` array every time `syncAccount` is called. However, when calling `syncAccount` for a new user, according to the current implementation, it is necessary to traverse the `programInfos` array. This may cause tx revert due to gas limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's take a look at the code snippet of `ProductManager.syncAccount`:

```solidity
//ProductManager.sol    L107
function syncAccount(
        ProductManager storage self,
        IProduct product,
        address account,
        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory currentOracleVersion
    ) internal {

        // Add any unseen programs
->      uint256 fromProgramId = self.nextProgramFor[account];//when account is new user, fromProgramId = 0
        uint256 toProgramId = self.programInfos.length;
        for (uint256 programId = fromProgramId; programId < toProgramId; programId++) {//loop from 0 to toProgramId
->          self.activeProgramsFor[account].add(programId);
        }
        self.nextProgramFor[account] = toProgramId;

        // Settle programs
        uint256[] memory activeProgramIds = self.activeProgramsFor[account].values();//whole programInfos array
        for (uint256 i; i < activeProgramIds.length; i++) {//traverse the whole array
            uint256 programId = activeProgramIds[i];
            Program storage program = self.programs[programId];
->          program.settle(product, self.programInfos[programId], account, currentOracleVersion);//More gas is consumed here.
            if (!self.activePrograms.contains(programId) && currentOracleVersion.version >= program.versionComplete) {
                self.activeProgramsFor[account].remove(programId);
            }
        }
    }
```

The entire tx call process is as follows:

```flow
Product._settleAccount
  Incentivizer.syncAccount
    ProductManager.syncAccount	//assuming self.programInfos.length = 50
      1.  program.settle
      2.  program.settle
      ...
      50. program.settle
```

`Product._settleAccount` is a very important function, which is part of modifier `settleForAccount`. The modifier `settleForAccount` is used in `openTakeFor`/`closeTakeFor`/`openMakeFor`/`closeMakeFor`/`closeAll`.

Because useless incentive programs will not be deleted. As time goes by, there are more and more incentive programs for the product, and `programInfos` array will become larger and larger. Once a certain length is exceeded, DOS will occur due to the maximum gas limit of a block.

## Impact

- When the `programInfos.length` of `ProductManager` exceeds a certain value, this product can no longer have new users. BecauseÂ  `openTakeFor`/`openMakeFor` from new user will revert.
- Some old users are also affected here. Old users come back after leaving for a long time. If the difference between the value in `nextProgramFor` and `programInfos.length` exceeds a certain value, the same problem will actually occur.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if `account` is a new user in `ProductManager.syncAccount`, if yes, add all programIds in `self.activePrograms`. Then assign `self.nextProgramFor[account]` to `self.programInfos.length`.
