# Cached Address can be changed by anyone

## Summary

We cache an address if it is new in the mapping `addressLookup`. But it can be overwritten by anyone  in the current case.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _cacheAddress(address value) private {
        uint256 index = addressCache.length;
        addressCache.push(value);
        addressLookup[value] = index;

        emit AddressAddedToCache(value, index);
    }
```

Here, there is no check to ensure that the `value` is not already cached in another index. thus can be overwritten.
## Impact

Result will be 
- `addressLookup` mapping will not work as intended. Hence if any external actors or protocols use this mapping as a source of truth , it will hamper them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that ` require addressLookup[value]  ==(0) ;
