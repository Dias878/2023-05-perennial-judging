# `USDC` depeg risk will affect collateral

## Summary

`USDC` depeg risk will affect collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

Perennial uses $USD proxies (i.e. USDC/DSU) as collateral and assumes the price of these assets is $1.

```solidity
    function _handleWrap(address receiver, UFixed18 amount) internal {
        // If the batcher is 0 or  doesn't have enough for this wrap, go directly to the reserve
        if (address(batcher) == address(0) || amount.gt(DSU.balanceOf(address(batcher)))) {
            reserve.mint(amount);
            if (receiver != address(this)) DSU.push(receiver, amount);
        } else {
            // Wrap the USDC into DSU and return to the receiver
            batcher.wrap(amount, receiver);
        }
    }


    /**
     * @notice Helper function to unwrap `amount` DSU into USDC and send to `receiver`
     * @param receiver Address to receive the USDC
     * @param amount Amount of DSU to unwrap
     */
    function _handleUnwrap(address receiver, UFixed18 amount) internal {
        // If the batcher is 0 or doesn't have enough for this unwrap, go directly to the reserve
        if (address(batcher) == address(0) || amount.gt(USDC.balanceOf(address(batcher)))) {
            reserve.redeem(amount);
            if (receiver != address(this)) USDC.push(receiver, amount);
        } else {
            // Unwrap the DSU into USDC and return to the receiver
            batcher.unwrap(amount, receiver);
        }
    }
```

This assumption will be broken in the case of depegs which have been shown to occur in the past. Depegs could lead to various effects including the devaluing of collateral.

Malicious users can take advantage during depeg events to profit through vectors such as liquidations.

The risk is more so evident for the balanced vault whose deposit and redeem functions don't have pause functionality.

## Impact

Devaluation of collateral can be exploited.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure measures are in place to handle depegs e.g add pause functionality to deposit and redeem functionality in the balanced vault.
