# Chainlink price feed can be stale

## Summary
The current implementation doesn't adequately validate the timestamp of the price feed data obtained from Chainlink. This can potentially result in outdated or stale data being used, impacting the precision and reliability of price feed data in the system.
## Vulnerability Detail
At present, the reported timestamp from the Chainlink price feed isn't being adequately verified within expected boundaries. This could result in Chainlink delivering stale or outdated price feed data.
