# XO- `Unchecked` Completion in `_complete()` Function Enables Rewards Theft

## Summary
- The vulnerability make the function does not validate the `programId` parameter, allowing an attacker to call the `_complete()` function with an invalid `programId.` As a result, the function completes a program that doesn't exist, this lead to steal token from users.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
*/
    function _complete(
        ProductManager storage self,
        IProduct product,
        uint256 programId
    ) internal returns (uint256 versionComplete) {
        versionComplete = self.programs[programId].complete(product, self.programInfos[programId]);
        self.activePrograms.remove(programId);
    }
    /*
```
-  There is s a vulnerability in the _complete function, the issue is that this line  
`versionComplete = self.programs[programId].complete(product, self.programInfos[programId]);` does not check to see if the `programId` is valid, means that an attacker could call the `_complete()` function with an invalid `programId,` and the function would complete a program that does not exist.
## Impact
- An attacker could create an invalid programId and then call the `_complete()` function with that invalid `programId.` The function would then complete the invalid program, which would allow the attacker to steal rewards from the contract.
- An attacker could manipulate the market to create an invalid `programId.` For example, the attacker could buy up all of the tokens for a particular program, which would effectively make the program invalid. The attacker could then call the `_complete()` function with the invalid `programId` and steal rewards from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adding `require(valid(self, programId));` to the `_complete()` function,this can help to ensure that the function is effective and that it cannot be bypassed by an attacker.
