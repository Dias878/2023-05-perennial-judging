# ChainlinkAggregator.getStartingRoundId reverts for invalid phase which means that Oracle can get broken

## Summary
When a phase switchover happens in the `ChainlinkFeedOracle`, it's possible that in between the phase of the `_lastSyncedRoundId` and the phase of the `latestRound.roundId` there are other phases.

The logic in the `ChainlinkAggregator` library (that `ChainlinkFeedOracle` makes use of) has an execution path that requires to loop over the phases in between and query their `startingRoundId`.

In the case of an invalid phase (e.g. aggregator is set to `address(0)`) this will revert and the phase switchover will be blocked.
Since the whole Perennial application requires the `sync` function to succeed, this will DOS the whole application.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a phase switchover occurs, the `ChainlinkAggregator` library will loop over the phases to find the next `roundId`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L88-L91

This calls the `getStartingRoundId` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L104-L112

And this function reverts if the `phaseId` points to an invalid phase (invalid phase means e.g. that the aggregator for that phase is set to the zero address which reverts within the `AggregatorProxy`: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/270a179fb3c0233fe7c8b49229ea5cf9a44b116a/contracts/src/v0.6/AggregatorProxy.sol#L184).

This means that the upstream call to `sync` reverts (which initiated the phase switchover) and the Perennial application is DOSed.

The faulty assumption that is made by the `ChainlinkAggregator` library is that if phase `p` and phase `p+x` are valid, all phases in between (`p+1`, `p+2`, ...) are also valid. This is not a valid assumption based on the Chainlink source code and the Chainlink documentation.

## Impact
The Perennial application ends up DOSed and users cannot open / close positions and may get unfairly liquidated.
Also they cannot close losing trades which leads to a direct loss of funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `getStartingRoundId` function, call `_tryGetProxyRoundData` instead of calling `proxy.getRoundData` directly:
