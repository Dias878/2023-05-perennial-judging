# Different payoff calculation for short and long may lead to vault imbalance

## Summary
The balanced vault uses the concept of market, defined as the union of two products: short and long.
It is possible to define oracle payoffs for short and long market which are substantially different, breaking some core logic.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the balanced vault it is assumed that the prices returned by the long and short product oracles can be used interchangeably:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L664

The fact that one can define different payoffs for short and longs breaks this assumption. When we check how these payoffs are defined in `BalancedVaultDefinition.sol`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVaultDefinition.sol#L109-L113

We see that `longPayoff.data == shortPayoff.data` is enforced, however there is a missing check on `type` which can be either
`PASSTHROUGH` or `CONTRACT`. Since the latter allows for an arbitrary function on the price returned by the chainlink oracle, these two values can be vastly different.

## Impact
This can lead the balanced vault to misaccount the leverage on the short product and get liquidated.

## Recommendation
Enforce `longPayoff.type == shortPayoff.type`.
