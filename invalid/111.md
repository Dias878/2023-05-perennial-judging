# XO-`divOut()` Function Does Not Handle Negative `b` Values Correctly

## Summary
- The `divOut()` function in the `NumberMath` library does not properly handle cases where the `b` parameter is negative,this is a vulnerability that can  lead to incorrect results in division operations.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
*/
    function divOut(int256 a, int256 b) internal pure returns (int256) {
        return sign(a) * sign(b) * int256(divOut(SignedMath.abs(a), SignedMath.abs(b)));
    }
    /**
```
- so the vulnerability is in  the `divOut()` function, this  function is used to divide two `int256` values. so the problem here  is that the `divOut()` function does not take into account the fact that the `b` value can be `negative`. This can happen if the user passes in a `negative` value for the `b` parameter so If the `b` value is negative, then the `divOut()` function will divide by a negative number, which will cause the result to be incorrect. This could result in financial losses for users, as they may lose money due to incorrect calculations.
## Impact
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker an this going to lead to steal users' funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- To fix this vulnerability is by  checking the `b` parameter to make sure it is not `zero`. If the `b` parameter is zero, then the `divOut` function can return a default value, such as zero. This will prevent the contract from crashing and protect users from financial losses.
