# `BalancedVault` `sync()` can be gamed to gain an advantage

## Summary

`BalancedVault` `sync()` can be gamed to gain an advantage

## Vulnerability Detail

When `BalancedVault::sync()` is called the global context is updated while the account context is not. Users can call this function just before price movements to have global variables updated. 

```solidity
    function sync() external {
        syncAccount(address(0));
    }
```

They will then gain an advantage by calling `BalancedVault::syncAccount()` to process their delayed deposits or redemptions to either enter a position or exit a position based on the price movements that they are aware of and have timed.

```solidity
    function syncAccount(address account) public {
        (EpochContext memory context, ) = _settle(account);
        _rebalance(context, UFixed18Lib.ZERO);
    }
```

By being able to time price movements and the sync of global variables and account variables, they gain an advantage by syncing their account just in time to either avoid losses or to gain profit.

## Impact

Sophisticated users gain an unfair advantage in avoiding losses and earning profits.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Updating the global variables with pending amounts should coincide with the update of accounts' pending amounts.
