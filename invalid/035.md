# If `controller().minCollateral()` is changed, it will cause some of the collateral funds to be unable to be withdrawn

## Summary

If `controller().minCollateral()` is changed, it will cause some of the collateral funds to be unable to be withdrawn

## Vulnerability Detail

As we can see ,the modifer will check `accountCollateral.lt(controller().minCollateral())`
```solidity
    modifier collateralInvariant(address account, IProduct product) {
        _;

        UFixed18 accountCollateral = collateral(account, product);
        if (!accountCollateral.isZero() && accountCollateral.lt(controller().minCollateral()))//@audit
            revert CollateralUnderLimitError();
    }
```
And this modifer will using in such `withdrawFrom()`. However, if `controller().minCollateral()` is changed, it will cause some of the collateral funds to be unable to be withdrawn
```solidity
    function withdrawFrom(address account, address receiver, IProduct product, UFixed18 amount)
    public
    nonReentrant
    notPaused
    notZeroAddress(receiver)
    isProduct(product)
    onlyAccountOrMultiInvoker(account)
    settleForAccount(account, product)
    collateralInvariant(account, product)//@audit
    maintenanceInvariant(account, product)
    {
        amount = amount.eq(UFixed18Lib.MAX) ? collateral(account, product) : amount;
        _products[product].debitAccount(account, amount);
        token.push(receiver, amount);

        emit Withdrawal(account, product, amount);
    }
```

As we can see, the `minCollateral` can be changed by onwer
```solidity
function updateMinCollateral(UFixed18 newMinCollateral) public onlyOwner(0) {//@audit minCollateral can be changed by onwer
        _minCollateral.store(newMinCollateral);
        emit MinCollateralUpdated(newMinCollateral);
    }
```
Such, if  Alice collateral 100 U, and now the `minCollateral` is 90 U, it 's not error.And then, the onwer changed the `minCollateral` is 101 U, and Alice wants to call withdrawFrom to withdraw collateral .It will cause error because of the `minCollateral` is 101 U.

## Impact

it will cause some of the collateral funds to be unable to be withdrawn
