# XO- Storage Pointer Vulnerability in  `JumpRateUtilizationCurveLib ` and  `_storagePointer` function

## Summary
- The `_storagePointer` function uses the slot keyword to get the address of the storage for the object. The slot keyword can cause a reentrancy attack, this allow  attacker to execute arbitrary code on the blockchain.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
    function _storagePointer(JumpRateUtilizationCurveStorage self)
    private pure returns (JumpRateUtilizationCurve storage pointer) {
        assembly ("memory-safe") { pointer.slot := self }
    }
}
```
-There is a vulnerability in the `_storagePointer` function,  this function is used to get a `reference` to the storage for a `JumpRateUtilizationCurve` object. The `_storagePointer` function uses the `slot` keyword to get the address of the storage for the object, so the problem is  that the `slot` keyword is not safe to use in Solidity, the `slot` keyword can cause a` reentrancy` attack, that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the blockchain.
## Impact
-   an attacker can exploited this vulnerability and  cause a reentrancy attack, which can allow  attacker to drain all of the target's funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `_storagePointer` function should use the address `keyword` to get the address of the storage for the object. The address keyword is safe to use in Solidity and does not cause `reentrancy attacks`.
