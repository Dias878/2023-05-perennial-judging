# XO-`updateUtilizationCurve` function does not check if the `newUtilizationCurve` is actually a valid `JumpRateUtilizationCurve`.

## Summary
- The vulnerability pertains to the `updateUtilizationCurve `function. The issue lies in the absence of a validation check for the `newUtilizationCurve` parameter, which represents a `JumpRateUtilizationCurve.` This omission allows an attacker to craft a malicious `JumpRateUtilizationCurve` with invalid values for the `minRate,` `maxRate,` or `targetRate `properties. By invoking the `updateUtilizationCurve` function with this malevolent curve, the attacker can trigger a contract revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
 */
    function updateUtilizationCurve(IProduct product, JumpRateUtilizationCurve memory newUtilizationCurve) external onlyOwnerOrParamAdmin {
        if (newUtilizationCurve.minRate.unpack().abs().gt(MAX_CURVE_RATE)
            || newUtilizationCurve.maxRate.unpack().abs().gt(MAX_CURVE_RATE)
            || newUtilizationCurve.targetRate.unpack().abs().gt(MAX_CURVE_RATE)

    /**
```
- There is a vulnerability  in the `updateUtilizationCurve` function. The problem with is that there is a line in the function it does not check if the `newUtilizationCurve` is actually a valid `JumpRateUtilizationCurve.` This means that an attacker could create a malicious `JumpRateUtilizationCurve` that has invalid values for the `minRate,` `maxRate,` or `targetRate` properties. If the attacker were able to do this, they could then call the `updateUtilizationCurve` function and cause the contract to revert.
## Impact
- An attacker could create a malicious `JumpRateUtilizationCurve` that has invalid values for the `minRate,` `maxRate,` or `targetRate` properties. If the attacker were able to do this, they could then call the `updateUtilizationCurve` function and cause the contract to revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  added `require(newUtilizationCurve.isValid());` to the function, to check if the `newUtilizationCurve` is actually a valid `JumpRateUtilizationCurve.` If it is not, the function will revert.
