# `_aggregatorRoundIdToProxyRoundId()` does not follow the correct logic

## Summary

L170 of ChainlinkAggregator.sol states that the `_aggregatorRoundIdToProxyRoundId()` function is to follow the `roundid-in-proxy` logic from chainlink

```solidity
     * @dev Follows the logic specified in https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/historical-data#roundid-in-proxy

```

But unlike the implementation for getting the roundId from chainlink, `_aggregatorRoundIdToProxyRoundId()` uses a bitwise shift and arithmetic addition operation to compose `roundId` from `phaseId` and `aggregatorRoundId`.

```solidity
return (uint256(phaseId) << 64) + aggregatorRoundId;
```

Whereas the [original implementation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data#roundid-in-proxy), uses a bitwise shift and a `bitwise OR operation`

```solidity
roundId = uint80((uint256(phaseId) << 64) | aggregatorRoundId);

```

This change introduces undesired behaviour and bugs due to differences in how arithmetic addition and bitwise OR operations handle overlapping bits.

## Vulnerability Detail

The key difference lies in the usage of arithmetic addition (`+`) instead of bitwise OR (`|`). These two operators can sometimes behave in the same way, but there are crucial differences:

- Arithmetic addition (`+`): This operation actually adds the numeric values together, which can lead to unexpected results if there are overlapping bits, essentially causing a "carry" operation to the higher bits.

- Bitwise OR (`|`): This operation combines the bits of the two numbers without a carry. It is often used in situations where we want to ensure that two sets of bits don't interfere with each other.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Convert an aggregator round ID into a proxy round ID for the given phase
     * @dev Follows the logic specified in https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/historical-data#roundid-in-proxy
     * @param phaseId phase ID for the given aggregator round
     * @param aggregatorRoundId round id for the aggregator round
     * @return Proxy roundId
     */

    function _aggregatorRoundIdToProxyRoundId(uint16 phaseId, uint80 aggregatorRoundId) private pure returns (uint256) {
        return (uint256(phaseId) << 64) + aggregatorRoundId;
    //  @audit the above differs from chainlink's implementation roundId = uint80((uint256(phaseId) << 64) | aggregatorRoundId);
    }
}
```

Copy paste this contract into remix

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract RoundIdTest {
    uint phaseId = 1;
    uint aggregatorRoundId = 2 ** 80 - 1;

    function getRoundIdWithAddition() public view returns (uint256) {
        return (uint256(phaseId) << 64) + aggregatorRoundId;
    }

    function getRoundIdWithBitwiseOr() public view returns (uint256) {
        return (uint256(phaseId) << 64) | aggregatorRoundId;
    }

    function test() public view returns (string memory) {
        uint256 roundIdAdd = getRoundIdWithAddition();
        uint256 roundIdOr = getRoundIdWithBitwiseOr();

        if (roundIdAdd != roundIdOr) {
            return "Inconsistent roundId computation!";
        } else {
            return "RoundId computation is consistent.";
        }
    }
}
```

The `test` function will return "Inconsistent roundId computation!" cause there is a difference in roundId computation due to arithmetic addition and bitwise OR operation, showing the issue.

## Impact

By using arithmetic addition instead of bitwise OR, it could lead to incorrect values for `roundId` whenever there are overlapping bits in `phaseId` and `aggregatorRoundId`. In other words, if a bit is set in the same position in both `phaseId` and `aggregatorRoundId`, arithmetic addition will cause this bit to "carry over" into the next higher bit, while bitwise OR would not. This carry-over could result in `roundId` having an incorrect value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to stick with the original implementation which uses bitwise OR operation to combine `phaseId` and `aggregatorRoundId`. This method is safer as it avoids potential issues from bit overlap that can occur with arithmetic addition.
