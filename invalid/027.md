# _unsettle would over-emit rewards by multiplying the total `amountPerShare` directly on userPosition

## Summary
_unsettle would over-emit rewards by multiplying the total `amountPerShare` directly on userPosition

## Vulnerability Detail
ProgramInfo has a function `amountPerShare` that divides total amount by the duration (in second) of a reward incentive program. So this is effectively `amountPerSecond`. However the function is used to multiply by the share delta then by the position size of a user during `_unsettled` in Program.

This means user would claim ` user_position_size * share_change_during_period * reward_per_second_for_EVERYONE`.  

This reward is quite over-blown as the reward is not divided across the entire maker/taker population.


```solidity
/// @dev ProgramInfo type
struct ProgramInfo {
    /// @dev Coordinator for this program
    uint256 coordinatorId;

    /// @dev Amount of total maker and taker rewards
    Position amount;

    /// @dev start timestamp of the program
    uint256 start;

    /// @dev duration of the program (in seconds)
    uint256 duration;
```

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Returns the maker and taker amounts per position share
     * @param self The ProgramInfo to operate on
     * @return programFee Amounts per share
     */
    function amountPerShare(ProgramInfo memory self) internal pure returns (Accumulator memory) {
        return self.amount.div(self.duration);
    }
```

```solidity
        Accumulator memory globalShareDelta = product.shareAtVersion(toVersion).sub(product.shareAtVersion(fromVersion));
        Accumulator memory computedUserShareDelta = product.position(account).mul(globalShareDelta);
        amount = UFixed18Lib.from(programInfo.amountPerShare().mul(computedUserShareDelta).sum());
```
## Impact
rewards are over-emitted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
divide the `rewardsPerShare` over the entire maker/taker population. using this `rewardPerSharePerSecond` to further multiply by user position to come up with a reward claimable for the user.
