# XO-`_versionToPhase` Function Allows `Unauthorized Access`

## Summary
-  the `_versionToPhase` function. contain a vulnerability this function is is used to convert a version number to a phase. the problem is that the function will stop iterating if the phase `ID` reaches `0`, this can exploit by an attacker and cause  unauthorized access to the contract or manipulate the system.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function _versionToPhase(uint256 version) private view returns (Phase memory phase) {
        uint256 phaseId = _latestPhaseId();
        phase = _phases[phaseId];
        while (uint256(phase.startingVersion) > version) {
            phaseId--;
            phase = _phases[phaseId];
        }
    }
```
- The vulnerability in the `_versionToPhase` function, the function iterates through the phases until it finds a phase with a starting version that is less than or equal to the version, the problem is  in this loop. The loop will stop if the phase `ID` reaches `0`, even if the version is still greater than the starting version of any phase. means that the `_versionToPhase` function will return an `invalid` phase if the version is greater than the starting version of the last phase, this can  exploited by an attacker to create an invalid phase. and the attacker could then submit this invalid phase to the contract, which would allow the attacker to bypass the security checks that are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the contract.
## Impact
-  attacker can bypass security measures and potentially gain unauthorized access to the contract or manipulate the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  change the loop in the `_versionToPhase` function so that it continues to iterate even if the phase `ID` reaches `0`. This would ensure that the `_versionToPhase` function will never return an invalid phase.
