# PriceOracle is a single point of failure, should have alternative price feeds as back up.

## Summary
Perennial depends on chainlink alone for pricing data. Incase of any failure to provide pricing information for products in perennial, there is no alternative source setup.

It would be better if perennial implements an internal mechanism to identify the price as stale and halt activity for such product until normalcy is restored.

## Vulnerability Detail
Stale prices poses risk to the assets on Perennial. Perennial as a generic derivatives platform should provision to add atleast one more price source as fallback incase of an unforeseen scenario.

if no other option is available as pricing feed, the project should provision to allow authorised parties manually update prices in the case of extreme scenarios, This is will ensure that project will be able to recover incase the price feed for some of the products is stale.

Also, implement a mechanism where the perennial detects a price for certain asset becoming stale.It might be based on the time passed between now and last time the price was update in phases. If that duration is passed, the system should allow for manual emergency update of prices or freeze activity on the asset with stale prices to help recover efficiently.

## Impact
Lack of such mechanism is the concern in extreme scenarios. A stale price without any guard like freezing activity on asset creates arbitrate opportunities for participates that can exploit the stale prices to their benefit.


## Code Snippet
In the below functions for take and make, there is no logic to check if the oracle prices are stale.  Incase the prices are stale for a given asset, the system should prevent any change in position or until the admin has enabled manual update for prices as emergency to help the perennial system function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
a) Ideally, provision an alternative pricing source for each product as secondary source incase of any emergency situation
b) provision a manual admin of prices by Admin for a short time window incase the price sources are down
c) limit the product/position activity when price feed is done due to reasons outside of control.
