# Chainlink price "answer"  is not validated

## Summary
Currently, the oracle contracts do not validate the "answer" parameters returned by Chainlink that provide the price data. In scenarios where the price returned is 0, which is highly unusual and indicative of a problem, the contract should disregard such an answer. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The "answer" parameters returned by Chainlink, which provide the price data, are not currently verified within the oracle contracts. If the price returned is 0 - a highly unlikely situation that typically suggests an issue - the contract should be set to ignore such an answer from the price feed.
