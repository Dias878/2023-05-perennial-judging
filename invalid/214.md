# when their are no positions in the que the protocol wont allow the taker to make position

## Summary
when there are no positions in the queue it will get back `1e18` which in some markets it will revert. So with users call this function when there are no ques will cause reverts which should not happen
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the modifier maxUtilizationInvariant uses `unsafeDiv` on pre.taker and pre.maker so if they are both zero it will return `1e18` and it will revert causing some users who called the function to revert and maybe not be able to close their position their causing some loss and having to wait until the next oracle settlement. 
## Impact
gas loss/ time impact loss with settlements
## Code Snippet
```solidity
// utilization
//@audit since the function will return 1e18 when both are zero, it will revert  
        UFixed18 utilization = next.taker.unsafeDiv(next.maker) ;
        if (utilization.gt(UFixed18Lib.ONE.sub(utilizationBuffer()))) 
            revert ProductInsufficientLiquidityError(utilization);
```
```solidity
    function unsafeDiv(UFixed18 a, UFixed18 b) internal pure returns (UFixed18) {
        if (isZero(b)) {
            return isZero(a) ? ONE : MAX;
        } else {
            return div(a, b);
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
all markets should have a mandatory buffer or if the result is `1e18` then make it zero and don't revert
