# Possible underflow in Fixed18Lib.sub() function

## Summary

The sub() function in Fixed18Lib may not handle underflow conditions correctly. This could result in incorrect mathematical results which can be exploited.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Fixed18Lib library, the `sub()` function does not perform an underflow check. This function subtracts one Fixed18 value from another. If the result is less than the minimum value that an int256 can hold, this will result in an underflow.

```solidity
function sub(Fixed18 a, Fixed18 b) internal pure returns (Fixed18) {
    return Fixed18.wrap(Fixed18.unwrap(a) - Fixed18.unwrap(b));
}
```
## Impact

If an underflow occurs, it will cause incorrect mathematical calculations and could potentially be exploited by a malicious user to manipulate contract state in unintended ways. This could result in loss of funds or other detrimental outcomes depending on how the function is used in the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Fixed18Lib.sol
function sub(Fixed18 a, Fixed18 b) internal pure returns (Fixed18) {
    return Fixed18.wrap(Fixed18.unwrap(a) - Fixed18.unwrap(b));
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a check to prevent underflow conditions. You can make use of the OpenZeppelin SafeMath library which provides functions for safe subtraction that throw an exception on underflow. 

## Proof Of Concept

1. Create an instance of a contract that uses the Fixed18Lib library.
2. Call the `sub()` function with two Fixed18 values such that their difference would be less than the minimum value of an int256.
3. Observe that the function does not revert and instead returns an incorrect result.
