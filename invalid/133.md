# Chainlink getRoundData return value should check timestamp

## Summary

The round corresponding to the acquired roundID may not be completed and the data is incomplete. You need to check the timestamp of the returned value  is greater than 0.   

## Vulnerability Detail

According to Chainlink [docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data#getrounddata-return-values): 
> A read can revert if the caller is requesting the details of a round that was invalid or has not yet been answered. If you are deriving a round ID without having observed it before, the round might not be complete. To check the round, validate that the timestamp on that round is not 0. In a best-case scenario, rounds update chronologically. However, a round can time out if it doesn't reach consensus. Technically, that is a timed out round that carries over the answer from the previous round.

## Impact

Oracle round not completed, data error
