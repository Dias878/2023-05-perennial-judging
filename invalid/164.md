# XO-`_transform` function does not check if the `payoffDefinition` is actually a valid `PayoffDefinition`

## Summary
- The vulnerability is present in the `_transform` function . The function fails to validate whether the `payoffDefinition` is a valid `PayoffDefinition` object. This opens up the possibility for an attacker to create a malicious `PayoffDefinition` with invalid values for properties such as `strikePrice,` `expirationDate,` or `payoffFunction.` , the attacker can call the `_transform` function and trigger a contract revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 */
    function _transform(IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory oracleVersion)
    internal view virtual returns (IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory) {
        oracleVersion.price = payoffDefinition().transform(oracleVersion.price);
        return oracleVersion;
    }
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the _transform function, so the problem is that there is a line in the function  does not check if the `payoffDefinition` is actually a valid `PayoffDefinition.` This means that an attacker could create a malicious `PayoffDefinition` that has invalid values for the `strikePrice,` `expirationDate,` or `payoffFunction` properties. If the attacker were able to do this, they could then call the `_transform` function and cause the contract to revert.
## Impact
- An attacker could create a malicious `PayoffDefinition` that has invalid values for the `strikePrice,` `expirationDate,` or `payoffFunction` properties. If the attacker were able to do this, they could then call the  `_transform` function and cause the contract to revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- added `require(payoffDefinition.isValid());` to the `_transform` function this will check if the `payoffDefinition` is actually a valid `PayoffDefinition.` If it is not, the function will revert.
