# XO-Insecure Parameter Validation in `execute()` Function of `UCrossChainOwner` Contract

## Summary
- The vulnerability is in the `execute()` function in the `UCrossChainOwner` contract does not validate the `to` parameter. This means that an attacker can pass in a malicious address, which could then be used to steal funds from the `UCrossChainOwner` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function execute(
        address payable to,
        bytes memory data,
        uint256 value
    ) payable external onlyOwner returns (bytes memory ret) {
        if (data.length == 0) {
            Address.sendValue(to, value);
        } else {
            ret = Address.functionCallWithValue(to, data, value);
        }
    }
}
```
- The `execute()` function in the `UCrossChainOwner` contract does not check to make sure that the `to` parameter is a valid contract address. This means that an attacker could pass in a malicious address, which could then be used to steal funds from the `UCrossChainOwner` contract.
## Impact
- The bulnerability allows an attacker to steal funds from the` UCrossChainOwner` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  The `execute()` function should be `updated` to validate the `to` parameter. This can be done by using the` address.isContract()` function to check if the address is a valid contract address.
