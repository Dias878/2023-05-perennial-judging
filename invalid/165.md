# XO-` SyncTo`  function does not check if the ` versionTo`  is actually greater than or equal to the ` latestVersion` .

## Summary
- `syncTo` function is vulnerable . The function lacks a check to ensure that the provided `versionTo` is greater than or equal to the `latestVersion` stored in the contract. This allows an attacker to create a malicious `versionTo` that is lower than the `latestVersion` and trigger a contract revert by calling the `syncTo` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 */
    function syncTo(
        AccountAccumulator storage self,
        VersionedAccumulator storage global,
        AccountPosition storage position,
        uint256 versionTo
    ) internal returns (Accumulator memory value) {
        Accumulator memory valueAccumulated = global.valueAtVersion(versionTo)
            .sub(global.valueAtVersion(self.latestVersion));
        value = position.position.mul(valueAccumulated);
        self.latestVersion = versionTo;
    }
}
```
- There is a vulenrability in the syncTo function, so the problem is in  the line in the function  does not check if the `versionTo` is actually greater than or equal to the `latestVersion.` This means that an attacker could create a malicious `versionTo` that is less than the `latestVersion.` If the attacker were able to do this, they could then call the `syncTo` function and cause the contract to revert.
## Impact
- An attacker  create a malicious `versionTo` that is less than the `latestVersion.` If the attacker were able to do this, they could then call the `syncTo` function and cause the contract to revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- add this` require(versionTo >= self.latestVersion);` to check if the `versionTo` is actually greater than or equal to the `latestVersion.` If it is not, the function will revert.
