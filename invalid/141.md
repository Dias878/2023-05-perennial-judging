# Perennial doesn't convert DSU to the USD and in case of depeg, this can be a problem

## Summary
Perennial doesn't convert DSU to the USD and in case of depeg, this can be a problem
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, Perennial users can deposit with DSU token only. This token is going to be 1:1 with USDC, which we already have seen depeged recently.

In case if this will happen again, that means, that user's collateral will be more precious, then it is in real, which will allow them to trade with bigger volumes and not to be liquidated. This can make big solvency problems for a protocol.
## Impact
Protocol can face insolvency.
