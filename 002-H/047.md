# Claim operations can revert or make the vault close to liquidations

## Summary
When users stake a claim to unclaimed assets, the vault code currently only validates if the total unclaimed amount exceeds the total balance. However, the process might falter as the claim action prompts a rebalance that initially pulls out collateral. If this collateral withdrawal reduces the existing collateral to less than the position, the claim operation could be disrupted.
## Vulnerability Detail
During the claim process for unclaimed assets, the vault code solely verifies if the total unclaimed amount surpasses the total balance. Yet, as the claim function triggers a rebalance which initially withdraws collateral, the process may fail if the collateral withdrawal results in a collateral balance that is less than the position.
