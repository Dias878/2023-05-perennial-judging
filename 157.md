# XO-`sum()` function does not check for `non-zero` values

## Summary
- The vulnerability in the `sum()` function, the function's failure to check whether both the `self.maker` and `self.taker` variables are 
`non-zero.` This allows an attacker to call the `sum()` function with an `accumulator` that has a zero value for `either` the maker or the taker variable, the `sum()` function would erroneously return a `zero` value, despite the accumulator potentially having a non-zero value for the other variable. 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  */
    function sum(Accumulator memory self) internal pure returns (Fixed18) {
        return self.maker.add(self.taker);
    }
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the `sum()` function, in the function there is a line that  not check to see if the `self.maker` and `self.taker` variables are both `non-zero` means that an attacker could call the `sum()` function with an accumulator that has a zero value for `either` the maker or the taker variable.This would cause the sum() function to return a zero value, even though the `accumulator` may have a `non-zero` value for the other variable.
## Impact
- This vulnerability can be exploited:
    - An attacker could create an accumulator with a zero value for the maker variable.
    - The attacker could then call the `sum()` function with the accumulator.
    - The `sum()` function would return a zero value, even though the accumulator may have a `non-zero` value for the taker variable.
    - The attacker could then use the zero value to manipulate the results of other functions that rely on the `sum()` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adding the check `require(self.maker.gt(0) || self.taker.gt(0));` to the `sum()` function, this can help to ensure that the function only returns a non-zero value if both the `self.maker` and `self.taker` variables are non-zero
