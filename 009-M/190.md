# Liquidators can prevent users from making their positions healthy during an unpause

## Summary
The Perennial protocol has a paused state in which all operations are paused. The protocol can be unpaused by privileged accounts. But when this unpause happens the liquidators can frontrun and liquidate user positions before those users get a chance to make their positions healthy.  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/collateral/Collateral.sol#L108-L135

## Vulnerability Detail
The `pauser` address can pause the perennial protocol using the `Controller.updatePaused` function. Once the protocol is paused all these operations cannot be done by users:
- Open/close/modify current make or take positions on a product.
- Deposit or withdraw collateral.
- Liquidate under-collateralized positions.

Though, real prices from oracles will surely move up or down during this paused period. If the oracle prices go down, the users won't be allowed to add more collateral to their positions or close their positions. Hence their positions will get under-collateralized (based upon real prices).

Once the protocol is unpaused the liquidators can front-run most users and liquidate their positions. Most users will not get a chance to make their position healthy.

This results in loss of funds for the users.

Perennial also has the concept of settlement delay. Any position opened/closed at oracle version `n` is settled at oracle version `n + 1`. This also alleviates the frontrunning liquidation issue. While validating an account's health before liquidation, the protocol only considers the current maintenance requirement for the account (not the next). This makes users more prone to getting front-runned and liquidated.

## Impact
By front-running any collateral deposit or position closure of a legitimate user which became under-collateralized during the paused state, the liquidator can unfairly liquidate user positions and collect liquidation profit as soon as the protocol is unpaused. This causes loss of funds to the user.

## Code Snippet

Collateral
```solidity
    function depositTo(address account, IProduct product, UFixed18 amount)
    external
    nonReentrant
    notPaused
    notZeroAddress(account)
    isProduct(product)
    collateralInvariant(account, product)
    {
        _products[product].creditAccount(account, amount);
        token.pull(msg.sender, amount);

        emit Deposit(account, product, amount);
    }
```

Product
```solidity
    function closeTakeFor(address account, UFixed18 amount)
        public
        nonReentrant
        notPaused
        onlyAccountOrMultiInvoker(account)
        settleForAccount(account)
        closeInvariant(account)
        liquidationInvariant(account)
    {
        _closeTake(account, amount);
    }

    function closeMakeFor(address account, UFixed18 amount)
        public
        nonReentrant
        notPaused
        onlyAccountOrMultiInvoker(account)
        settleForAccount(account)
        takerInvariant
        closeInvariant(account)
        liquidationInvariant(account)
    {
        _closeMake(account, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a grace period after unpausing during which liquidation remains blocked to allow users to avoid unfair liquidation by closing their positions or supplying additional collateral.
