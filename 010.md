# MultiInvoker.sol: Unwrap functionality fails when Reserve price drops below one

## Summary
There are several actions in the `MultiInvoker` that rely on the `_handleUnwrap` function which makes use of the DSU Reserve.

The issue is that when the DSU price in the Reserve drops below one, all the upstream functions relying on `_handleUnwrap` will fail which leads to a DOS of the `MultiInvoker`

## Vulnerability Detail
If the `batcher` is not set or does not have sufficient balance, `reserve.redeem` is called in order to redeem DSU for USDC:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/multiinvoker/MultiInvoker.sol#L368-L377

Based on the source code of the reserve contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x363af3acffed0b7181c2e3c56c00922e142100a8#code), the amount of USDC returned is calculated using the `redeemPrice()`:

```solidity
function redeem(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant notPaused {
    uint256 redeemAmount = _toUsdcAmount(redeemPrice().mul(amount).asUint256());

    _transferFrom(registry().dollar(), msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    _burnDollar(amount);
    _redeemVault(redeemAmount);
    _transfer(registry().usdc(), msg.sender, redeemAmount);

    emit Redeem(msg.sender, amount, redeemAmount);
}
```

Usually this price is one but it can drop below one:

```solidity
function redeemPrice() public view returns (Decimal.D256 memory) {
    return Decimal.min(reserveRatio(), Decimal.one());
}
```

When the redeem price drops below one is when the issue occurs because `MultiInvoker._handleUnwrap` will try to transfer USDC to the receiver at a 1-to-1 exchange rate (which will fail due to the insufficient USDC balance).

## Impact
The components integrating with the `MultiInvoker` will experience a DOS when the `redeemPrice()` drops below one.

## Code Snippet
Inspect the source code of the DSU Reserve here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x363af3acffed0b7181c2e3c56c00922e142100a8#code

Code from `MultiInvoker._handleUnwrap`:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `_handleUnwrap` function should query the DSU - USDC exchange rate from the Reserve contract

```solidity
function redeemPrice() public view returns (Decimal.D256 memory) {
    return Decimal.min(reserveRatio(), Decimal.one());
}
```

Based on this exchange rate, it needs to be calculated how much USDC will be received from the Reserve and this adjusted amount then needs to be pushed to the receiver.
