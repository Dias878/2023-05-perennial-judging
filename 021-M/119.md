# Users will cheat a Product when its makerFee/takerFee is more than its maintenance

## Summary
Since there is no check in `Product#initialize` that ensures that maintenance is always greater than makerFee/takerFee, a user would cheat products whose makerFee is higher than its maintenance.
The user would use the `minCollateral` amount of collateral to open a precalculated position such that:
- after debiting the open position fee, account position will pass the `maintenanceInvariant` check, but will be using the max leverage possible
- the open position fee deducted will be more than half of the user's collateral
- the close position fee deducted(which is equal to open position fee) will wipe out the remaining collateral and increase the product's shortfall.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since opening a position and closing a position debits an amount of fee(which are equal) from the user's collateral, a user would craft a position such that the collateral balance after debiting the open position fee would be less than the close position fee. This would add to the Product's debt shortfall.
There is a `maintenanceInvariant` check in openPosition functions that makes sure that debiting the openPosition fee from account's collateral will not make the balance less than the maintenance requirement. 
Therefore, in order to satisfy `maintenanceInvariant`, User would use the minCollateral (x) to open a position (y) such that y is the maximum value from this equation:
`x - (y * positionFee) > y * maintenance`

### ATTACK SCENARIO
- Product is launched with following configurations:
    - minCollateral=100
    - maintenance=0.25; max leverage=4x
    - takerFee=0.3(higher than maintenance)
- Malicious user Alice calculates the position he should open to maximally cheat the Product using the above inequality:
    - `100 - (y * 0.3) > y * 0.25`
    - Solving for y, we get `y < 181.8`
- So, Alice uses a collateral of 100 USDC to open a taker position of $181 (that is about 1.8x leverage)
- open position takerFee of `0.3 * 181 = 54` is debited from the account
- collateral balance of account is `100-54 = 46 USDC`; open taker position is 181; current leverage= `181/46=3.93`x
- Alice closes his position which would debit takerFee of `0.3 * 181 = 54` again
- since Alice collateral balance was 46, debiting a fee of 54 will increase shortfall of the product by `54-46=8`
- Alice has succeeded in increasing the Product's shortfall, and since Alice has been pardoned(i.e. No outstanding debt is recorded for him), He would repeat the attack again,thereby deliberately increasing the amount of debt the Product owner has to pay. This will also affect other users of the product as they will not be able to withdraw their collateral until Product owner resolves the shortfall.

Although it is unlikely(not impossible) that Protocol owned products will be well engineered and not susceptible to this, other individuals or organizations that may want to launch their own products must be protected from this vulnerability.

## Impact
A malicious user will deliberately increase a Product's shortfall; force Product owner to resolve the debt; Prevent other users of the product from withdrawing their collateral until Product owner resolves the shortfall.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing any of these:
- In `Product#initialize` function, include a check that prevents users from creating a product whose makerFee or takerFee is more than its maintenance
- The `maintenanceInvariant` check should make sure that the account should have enough margin for next settlement, even after debiting the closePosition fee.
