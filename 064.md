# Inconsistent oracle update frequencies can cause vault accounting errors

## Summary
A vault with two markets can experience accounting errors if the markets update their oracles at different frequencies.
## Vulnerability Detail
A vault that operates two markets can encounter discrepancies if these markets update their oracles at different frequencies. This variance can cause accounting errors during vault operations like depositing, and redeeming. Currently, vault code calculates assetsAtEpoch using only the most recent version stored by the vault, plus one. However, if there are newer versions, the vault may fail to account for these, resulting in unintended accounting behaviors. Here's an example:

Suppose a vault has an equal collateral of 100 units in both ARB and ETH markets, distributed 50-50 across both the short and long products, giving the vault a total collateral balance of 200 units.

Now imagine the ARB price drops significantly. Chainlink has a price deviation threshold on its oracles, which means if the price plunges quickly, the ARB product's version could rise dramatically compared to ETH, possibly updating every 10-15 minutes, or even every 2 minutes depending on the price deviation.

Assume that the first oracle version settled for ARB leads to a collateral balance of 125 (+5 fees) on the short market and 80 on the long market (due to ARB price drop). As the _assetsAtEpoch function currently covers version + 1, the vault accounts for this correctly so far.

But suppose 5 minutes later, another report is made on the Chainlink oracle, causing the ARB market to advance another version, leading to collateral balances of 160 (+10 fees) on the short market and 50 on the long. Now, the ARB market is two versions ahead of the ETH market. If a user deposits or redeems at this stage, they'll calculate the total assets in the current epoch as accumulated (latestVersion (for vault) + latestVersion + 1). Essentially, they'll be skipping the newest versions and all the accumulated fees on that part.

When the ETH oracle advances a version, users depositing or redeeming will calculate their amounts according to only the version and version + 1's accumulated fees/losses/profits.
## Impact
Since chainlink can speed up the oracle reports on price deviations one markets version can be way higher than the other market and the settlement of the vault is only done by version and version + 1 in the latest versions of the vault. This will skip the other advanced versions of the market that is advanced more than the other which is creating accounting error on any function depending on the assetsAtEpoch. 

While the primary concern lies with the redemption and deposit functions behaving incorrectly, it's broader than that. Any function that depends on assetsAtEpoch could potentially account inaccurately. As long as rebalancing remains unaffected, the overall health of the vault should be secure. This can be considered a medium or high-risk issue, especially if one market's oracle has advanced numerous versions ahead, but the vault skips these versions because the other market's oracle hasn't advanced yet.
