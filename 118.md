# Pragma isn't specified correctly which can lead to nonfunction/damaged contract when deployed on Arbitrum

## Summary

Arbitrum is not compatible with Solidity version 0.8.20, which has not been accounted for.

## Vulnerability Detail

The project `README.md` states that "Perennial is deployed on Ethereum and Arbitrum mainnets". Throughout the codebase (notably including Arbitrum specific contracts `UCrossChainOwnable_Arbitrum.sol` and `UCrossChainOwner_Arbitrum.sol`) a floating pragma is used, allowing the contracts to be compiled with any 0.8.x compiler higher than the specified version. The problem with this is that Arbitrum is [NOT compatible](https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support) with 0.8.20 and newer due to the introduction of a new opcode `PUSH0`. Contracts compiled with those versions will result in a nonfunctional or potentially damaged version that won't behave as expected. The default behavior of compiler would be to use the newest version which would mean by default it will be compiled with the 0.8.20 version which will produce broken code.

## Impact

Damaged or nonfunctional contracts when deployed on Arbitrum.

## Recommendation

Constrain pragma as follows:

    pragma solidity >=0.8.13 <=0.8.19
