# Phase is determined incorrectly for a oracle version inside ChainlinkOracle

## Summary
Phase is determined incorrectly for a oracle version inside ChainlinkOracle.
## Vulnerability Detail
This is similar report to the my report #1, but i believe that it should be separate.

`ChainlinkOracle.atVersion` function should return price of the specific oracle version.
In order to do that it needs to convert it chainlink round.

```solidity
    function _versionToRoundId(uint256 version) private view returns (uint256) {
        Phase memory phase = _versionToPhase(version);
        return uint256(phase.startingRoundId) + version - uint256(phase.startingVersion);
    }
    
   function _versionToPhase(uint256 version) private view returns (Phase memory phase) {
        uint256 phaseId = _latestPhaseId();
        phase = _phases[phaseId];
        while (uint256(phase.startingVersion) > version) {
            phaseId--;
            phase = _phases[phaseId];
        }
    }
```
`_versionToPhase` just goes through the phases and checks if their's phase.startingVersion is bigger than version that we need to find. In such way we should find a phase, were this version belongs to.

When new phase is created then it's `phase.startingVersion` is set to previous phase startingVersion + amount of rounds in previous phase. Because of that incorrect determination of phase is possible.

Let's look into example.
1.Phase 1 has phase.startingVersion == 0 and phase.startingRoundId == 101.
2.After 10 rounds it is finished. Which means that last oracle version is 10 now.
3.If you call `_versionToPhase` now, then you will receive 1, because it belongs to phase 1.
3.Round 205 is syncing and phase 2 is created and has phase.startingVersion == 0 + 10 and phase.startingRoundId == 201
4.If you call `_versionToPhase` now, then you will receive 2, which is incorrect.
## Impact
Wrong phase is determined which can lead to usage of wrong price and losses.
