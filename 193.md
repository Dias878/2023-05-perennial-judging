# protocolFee can be updated at any time by protocol

## Summary
`protocolFee` can be updated at any time by protocol. But it should settle the product first in order to make product coordinator receive fair payment for previous period.
## Vulnerability Detail
Perennial protocol has a fee that is taken from each product earnings.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/collateral/Collateral.sol#L161-L175
```solidity
    function settleProduct(UFixed18 amount) external onlyProduct {
        (IProduct product, IController controller) = (IProduct(msg.sender), controller());


        address protocolTreasury = controller.treasury();
        address productTreasury = controller.treasury(product);


        UFixed18 protocolFee = amount.mul(controller.protocolFee());
        UFixed18 productFee = amount.sub(protocolFee);


        _products[product].debit(amount);
        fees[protocolTreasury] = fees[protocolTreasury].add(protocolFee);
        fees[productTreasury] = fees[productTreasury].add(productFee);


        emit ProductSettle(product, protocolFee, productFee);
    }
```
This fee collecting is [done inside `settle` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/product/Product.sol#L127).

This fee [can be changed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/controller/Controller.sol#L221-L226) at any time. But the problem is that `settle` is not called for each product before the change. As result this change has impact on previous earning of product.

## Impact
Part of product earning can be stolen by protocol.

## Recommendation
Call `settle` for each product.
