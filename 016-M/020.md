# Users Funds could get stucked in protocol due to the dependency on epoch settling before Pending Deposit/Redemption are processed


## Summary

The protocol suffers from a critical issue where pending deposit and redemption requests can get stuck and remain unprocessed due to the dependency on epoch settling. This issue arises from the protocol's design, which requires the completion of epochs to be dependent on the advancement of all underlying oracles' versions. If any one of the oracles fails to update or advance its version, the protocol and vault may become stuck in the current epoch, preventing the processing of pending transactions. As a result, users pending redemptions can become effectively locked within the contract, impeding normal operations and causing frustration.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol's design requires all underlying oracles to advance their versions before an epoch can be considered complete. However, if any one of the oracles fails to update or advance its version, the protocol and vault will remain stuck in the current epoch. This dependency on all oracles advancing their versions poses a significant risk, as it can lead to a state of limbo where the protocol cannot progress to the next epoch.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Returns the current epoch
     * @return The current epoch
     */
    function currentEpoch() public view returns (uint256) {
        return currentEpochComplete() ? _latestEpoch + 1 : _latestEpoch;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Returns the whether the current epoch is currently complete
     * @dev An epoch is "complete" when all of the underlying oracles have advanced a version
     * @return Whether the current epoch is complete
     */
    function currentEpochComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        for (uint256 marketId; marketId < totalMarkets; marketId++) {
            if (
                Math.min(markets(marketId).long.latestVersion(), markets(marketId).short.latestVersion()) ==
                _versionAtEpoch(marketId, _latestEpoch)
            ) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
```

Note the L340: `     * @dev An epoch is "complete" when all of the underlying oracles have advanced a version`

The impact of a stuck epoch is twofold. Firstly, the protocol and vault are unable to move to the next epoch, resulting in a prolonged period of inactivity and hindering the protocol's ability to function as intended. Secondly, pending deposit and redemption requests remain unprocessed until an epoch can be successfully settled. This dependency on epoch completion creates a bottleneck in the protocol's functionality, causing delays and inconveniences for users.

[BalancedVault#L368-424:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/0f73469508a4cd3d90b382eac2112f012a5a9852/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L368-L424)

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Hook that is called before every stateful operation
     * @dev Settles the vault's account on both the long and short product, along with any global or user-specific deposits/redemptions
     * @param account The account that called the operation, or 0 if called by a keeper.
     * @return context The current epoch contexts for each market
     * @return accountContext The current epoch contexts for each market for the given account
     */
    function _settle(address account) private returns (EpochContext memory context, EpochContext memory accountContext) {
        (context, accountContext) = _loadContextForWrite(account);

// *lines ommited for report's brevity*

            // process pending deposit / redemption after new epoch is settled
            _deposit = _pendingDeposit;
            _redemption = _pendingRedemption;
            _pendingDeposit = UFixed18Lib.ZERO;
            _pendingRedemption = UFixed18Lib.ZERO;
        }

// *lines ommited for report's brevity*
}
```

When an epoch is stuck and unable to settle, all pending deposit and redemption requests remain in a pending state within the contract. As a result, users' funds become effectively locked within the contract, it also prevents normal operations as deposits wouldn't go through causing frustration for users.

## Impact

The combined impact of the stuck epoch and pending deposit/redemption processing dependency is as follows:

1. Inability to progress: The protocol and vault are unable to move to the next epoch if any underlying oracle fails to update or advance its version. This leads to prolonged periods of inactivity, hindering the protocol's ability to function as intended.

2. Delayed (Or forever not ) processing of pending depositions: Pending deposit and requests remain unprocessed until an epoch can be successfully settled. Users experience delays in depositing or their funds, causing inconvenience and potential frustration.

3. Funds lock-up: Users' funds involved in pending redemption requests are effectively locked within the contract when an epoch is stuck and cannot settle. This prevents normal operations and restricts users' ability to access their funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue two things should be revised:

1. Consider revising the epoch completion criteria to reduce reliance on the advancement of _all_ underlying oracles' versions.
   If not then Introduce alternative mechanisms or fallback solutions to prevent the protocol and vault from getting stuck in an epoch if one of the oracle fails to update.
   This could involve tracking each oracle independently and allowing for transaction processing even if an epoch doesn't settle. However, implementing such a solution would require careful consideration due to increased complexity.

2. Decoupling pending transaction processing from epoch completion: Explore options to decouple pending deposit and redemption processing from epoch completion. Implement mechanisms to process pending transactions separately, even if an epoch is unable to settle. This approach would ensure a smoother user experience and prevent funds from getting stuck within the contract.

By implementing these recommendations, the protocol can mitigate the risk of stuck epochs and ensure the timely processing of pending deposit and redemption requests. This will contribute to a more efficient and reliable user experience, addressing the issues caused by the dependency on epoch settling.
