# When the Product is Closed,  Users can close positions bypassing `takerInvarient` check allowing positions closed in an Unsafe Way

## Summary
When the product is closed, liquidators cannot liquidate accounts and close their positions. However, users can still close taker or make positions. Important check on maker/taker ratio can be bypassed allowing the positions to be closed in an unsafe way to the product.
## Vulnerability Detail
Liquidations would be halted when a product is closed. This is implemented through `notClosed()` modifier on `closeAll()`.
```solidity
//Product.sol
    modifier notClosed() {
        if (closed()) revert ProductClosedError();

        _;
    }
```
```solidity
//Product.sol
    function closeAll(address account) external onlyCollateral notClosed settleForAccount(account) {
...
```
However, user can still close their maker positions and taker positions because `notClosed()` is not implemented on `closeMakeFor()`. When user tries to close their maker position during product being closed, `takerInvarient()` check will be bypassed. `takerInvarient()` check for `socializationFactor` an important index on product liquidity as ratio of maker quantity divided by taker quantity. When this check on liquidity is bypassed, user can freely close their maker positions pushing the product to an undesired liquidity state (taker>maker).

```solidity
//Product.sol
    modifier takerInvariant() {
        _;

 |>       if (closed()) return;

        Position memory next = positionAtVersion(latestVersion()).next(_position.pre);
        UFixed18 socializationFactor = next.socializationFactor();

        if (socializationFactor.lt(UFixed18Lib.ONE)) revert ProductInsufficientLiquidityError(socializationFactor);
    }
```
```solidity
//Product.sol
    function closeMakeFor(
        address account,
        UFixed18 amount
    )
        public
        nonReentrant
        notPaused
        onlyAccountOrMultiInvoker(account)
        settleForAccount(account)
        takerInvariant
        closeInvariant(account)
        liquidationInvariant(account)
    {
        _closeMake(account, amount);
    }
```
## Impact
When a product is closed, liquidators cannot liquidate any positions but users can close more maker positions than the product is typically allowed, and the product is at risk of being in an unsafe liquidity state (taker>maker).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider not directly returning the function inside `takerInvariant()` when product is closed, instead, enforcing the check to ensure the product is safe.
