# Pauser role can pause the contracts and since its not the owner is can cause users not to be able to close their positions

## Summary
Since the pauser role is not mentioned in the readme its likey it can't be trusted so it can cause all contracts/deposit/withdraw/close to the be stuck for users 
## Vulnerability Detail
Pause role has too much control over public functions
like openTake, CloseTake, CloseMake,depositTo,withdrawTo
steps:
1. Bob(victim) makes 10 eth short position
2.  the price starts to rise exponentially causing Bob to get hit with a  huge  funding rate against him 
3. Bob tries to call closeTake
4.  Alice(pauser) frontrunns Bob and pauses the contract 
5.  Bob tx reverts and he is not able to close his position
## Impact
Bob incurs a loss  from not trusted actor
## Code Snippet
Just one of the functions but an important step for this attack
```solidity
    function closeTakeFor(address account, UFixed18 amount) 
        public
        nonReentrant
        notPaused
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make pauser more trusted/have an emergency function to withdraw/close position
