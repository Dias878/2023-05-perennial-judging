# BalancedVault.sol: reinitializer can be front-run to set an arbitrary name for the Vault token

## Summary
The `BalancedVault` contract is essentially a Version 2 for the existing Vaults.

This means the existing Vaults will be upgraded to the new `BalancedVault` implementation.

I am aware that it is generally not a valid H/M if an attacker can front-run an initializer, however in this instance it's affecting a live contract with actual funds in it (as opposed to a newly created contract when a protocol is initially deployed).

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the function to reinitialize the Vault to Version 2 which can be called by anyone and allows to set the `name` of the Vault token:

## Impact
The attacker can front-running the reinitalizer and set the `name` of the Vault token to any value which can lead to considerable reputational damage for the protocol.
E.g. the name could be set to "Scam Coin" or "PEPE".

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The reinitializer should check that it can only be called by a certain address, e.g. `controller.owner()`.
