# User would liquidate his account to sidestep `takerInvariant` modifier

## Summary
A single user could open a massive maker position, using the maximum leverage possible(and possibly reach the maker limit), and when a lot of takers open take positions, maker would liquidate his position, effectively bypassing the taker invariant and losing nothing apart from position fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the closeMakeFor function, there is a modifier called `takerInvariant`.
```solidity
function closeMakeFor(
        address account,
        UFixed18 amount
    )
        public
        nonReentrant
        notPaused
        onlyAccountOrMultiInvoker(account)
        settleForAccount(account)
        takerInvariant
        closeInvariant(account)
        liquidationInvariant(account)
    {
        _closeMake(account, amount);
    }
```
This modifier prevents makers from closing their positions if it would make the global maker open positions to fall below the global taker open positions.
A malicious maker can easily sidestep this by liquidating his own account.
Liquidating an account pays the liquidator a fee from the account's collateral, and then forcefully closes all open maker and taker positions for that account.
```solidity
function closeAll(address account) external onlyCollateral notClosed settleForAccount(account) {
        AccountPosition storage accountPosition = _positions[account];
        Position memory p = accountPosition.position.next(_positions[account].pre);

        // Close all positions
        _closeMake(account, p.maker);
        _closeTake(account, p.taker);

        // Mark liquidation to lock position
        accountPosition.liquidation = true; 
    }
```
This would make the open maker positions to drop significantly below the open taker position, and greatly increase the utilization ratio.

### ATTACK SCENARIO
- A new Product(ARB-Long) is launched on arbitrum with 20x max leverage(5% maintenance)
- Whale initially supplies $600k of collateral, and opens a maker position of $10mn, with 16.67x leverage.
- After 2 weeks of activity, global open maker position goes up to $15mn, and global open taker position gets to $12mn(80% utilization)
- Now, Whale can only close up to $3mn of his maker position using the `closeMakeFor` function because of the takerInvariant modifier.
- Whale decides to withdraw $100k, bringing his total collateral to $500k, and his leverage to 20x(which is the max leverage)
- Since he has taken the max leverage possible, his account will easily be liquidatable, so he just has to wait for the price of ARB to go a bit higher, then he calls liquidate on his account.
- Once he liquidates his account, he receives liquidationFee*totalMaintenance. his totalMaintenance is approximately $500k, and let's say liquidationFee is 20%, he receives $100k, and his maker position of $10mn is also closed. Now, he can withdraw his $400k collateral because he has no open positions.
- Global taker position is now $12mn, and global maker position is $5mn
- Whale has succeeded in bypassing the takerInvaraiant modifier, which was to prevent him from closing his maker position if it would make global maker position less than global taker position.

In addition,
- Funding fees would now be very high, so the currently open taker positions will be greatly penalized, and takers who are not actively monitoring their position could lose a lot.
- Whale would want to gain from the high funding fees, so he would open a maker position that would still keep the global maker position less than the global taker position(e.g. 200k at 15x leverage) so that taker positions will keep getting charged at the funding fee maxRate


## Impact
User will close his maker position when he shouldn't be allowed to, and it would cause open taker positions to be greatly impacted. And those who are not actively monitoring their open taker positions will suffer loss due to high funding fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing any of these:
- Protocol should receive a share of liquidation fee: This would disincentivize users from wanting to liquidate their own accounts, and they would want to keep their positions healthy and over-collateralized
- Let there be a maker limit on each account: In addition to the global maker limit, there should be maker limit for each account which may be capped at 5% of global maker limit. This would decentralize liquidity provisioning.
