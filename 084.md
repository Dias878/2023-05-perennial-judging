# Epoch can be complete when short oracle version is lagging

## Summary
An epoch can be deemed complete by a balanced vault, even if a short oracle has an earlier version

## Vulnerability Detail
To check if an epoch is completed, we need to check that both short and long oracles have advanced to the next version. If both start on the same version current check works fine:

But as we can see, current epoch is only set from long version:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L393

So if the short version is currently one version behind, since it is != from current version, the epoch can be marked as completed by the vault

Example:
Current epoch version = N

Balanced vault is comprised of two markets: 

Market 1:
    current short version = N-1
    current long version  = N+1

Market 2:
    current short version = N+1
    current long version  = N+1

currentEpochComplete = true.

If the lagging short version increases later, it will still allow for subsequent epoch updates, since it remains different (albeit lower than) current epoch version.

## Impact
The accounting of the vault is flawed, and may not rebalance correctly

## Recommendation
use `>=` comparator instead of `==`;
