# ChainlinkOracle.sol: When a new phase is entered a price with "updatedAt" timestamp prior to the last price update might be used

## Summary
The `ChainlinkOracle` contract downstream calls the Chainlink `FeedRegistry` to query prices.

It's possible that `aggregator` in the `FeedRegistry` is changed and a new `phase` is entered.

When the new `aggregator` is then queried for the latest price data, the price data may have an `updatedAt` timestamp that is earlier than the latest `updatedAt` timestamp of the previous aggregator.

This means that positions of users are opened, closed, liquidated with a new price that is older than the last price.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L59-L79

Assume the last time the Oracle was synced it was in phase 1 with ETH/USD price of $1800 and `updatedAt=100`.

Now the `aggregator` is changed by Chainlink (next `phase` is entered) and the next time `sync` is called the new `aggregator` is queried

The price may have been last updated before `timestamp 100` such that the return might look something like:
`answer=$1790, updatedAt=90`.

## Impact
Positions can be incorrectly opened, closed, liquidated with the old price.
E.g. a user might be unfairly liquidated due to the price at $1790 when actually the price never dropped there after the timestamp 100.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is necessary to check that for subsequent data from Chainlink `d` and `d+1` it holds true that `d.updatedAt < (d+1).updatedAt`. If this is not true the `sync` function must revert and wait for the new `aggregator` to get a new price update or fallback to the last price (the more recent one).
