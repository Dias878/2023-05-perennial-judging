# ChainlinkOracle.sol + ChainlinkFeedOracle.sol: When a new phase is entered a price with "updatedAt" timestamp prior to the last price update might be used

## Summary
The `ChainlinkOracle` contract downstream calls the Chainlink `FeedRegistry` to query prices.

It's possible that the `aggregator` in the `FeedRegistry` is changed and a new `phase` is entered.

When the new `aggregator` is then queried for the latest price data, the price data may have an `updatedAt` timestamp that is earlier than the latest `updatedAt` timestamp of the previous aggregator.

This means that positions of users are opened, closed, liquidated with a new price that is older than the last price.

The same scenario is possible in the `ChainlinkFeedOracle` as well which makes use of the Chainlink `AggregatorProxy`.

However this scenario is even rarer in the `ChainlinkFeedOracle` because some execution paths there contain the check that the timestamp from the next phase must be bigger than the last timestamp from the old phase.

Therefore in the next section I will show how this issue can occur in the `ChainlinkOracle`. The suggestion I give in the end applies to both the `ChainlinkOracle` and `ChainlinkFeedOracle`.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L59-L79

Assume the last time the Oracle was synced it was in phase 1 with ETH/USD price of $1800 and `updatedAt=100`.

Now the `aggregator` is changed by Chainlink (next `phase` is entered) and the next time `sync` is called the new `aggregator` is queried

The price may have been last updated before `timestamp 100` such that the return might look something like:
`answer=$1790, updatedAt=90`.

## Impact
Positions can be incorrectly opened, closed, liquidated with the old price.
E.g. a user might be unfairly liquidated due to the price at $1790 when actually the price never dropped there after the timestamp 100.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is necessary to check that for subsequent data from Chainlink `d` and `d+1` it holds true that `d.updatedAt < (d+1).updatedAt`. If this is not true the `sync` function must revert and wait for the new `aggregator` to get a new price update or fallback to the last price (the more recent one).
