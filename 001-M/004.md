# ChainlinkAggregator: binary search for roundId does not work correctly and Oracle can even end up temporarily DOSed

## Summary
When a phase switchover occurs, it can be necessary that phases need to be searched for a `roundId` with a timestamp as close as possible but bigger than `targetTimestamp`.

Finding the `roundId` with the closest possible timestamp is necessary according to the sponsor to minimize the delay of position changes:

![2023-05-25_13-55](https://github.com/roguereddwarf/images/assets/118631472/0eb0a93b-1a5e-41b2-91c4-884a51aed432)

The binary search algorithm is not able to find this best `roundId` which thereby causes unintended position changes.

Also it can occur that the `ChainlinkAggregator` library is unable to find a valid `roundId` at all (as opposed to only not finding the "best").

This would cause the Oracle to be temporarily DOSed until there are more valid rounds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at the binary search algorithm:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L123-L156

The part that we are particularly interested in is:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L139-L149

Let's say in a phase there's only one valid round (`roundId=1`) and the timestamp for this round is greater than `targetTimestamp`

We would expect the `roundId` that the binary search finds to be `roundId=1`.

The binary search loop is executed with `minRoundId=1` and `maxRoundId=1001`.

All the above conditions can easily occur in reality, they represent the basic scenario under which this algorithm executes.

`minRoundId` and `maxRoundId` change like this in the iterations of the loop:

```text
minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=1001

-> 

minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=501

-> 

minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=251

-> 

minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=126

-> 

minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=63

-> 

minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=32

-> 

minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=16

-> 

minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=8

-> 

minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=4

-> 

minRoundId=1
maxRoundId=2

Now the loop terminates because
minRoundId + 1 !< maxRoundId

```

Since we assumed that `roundId=2` is invalid, the function returns `0` (`maxTimestamp=type(uint256).max`):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/types/ChainlinkAggregator.sol#L153-L155

In the case that `latestRound.roundId` is equal to the `roundId=1`  (i.e. same phase and same round id which could not be found) there would be no other valid rounds that the `ChainlinkAggregator` can find which causes a temporary DOS.

## Impact
As explained above this would result in sub-optimal and unintended position changes in the best case.
In the worst-case the Oracle can be temporarily DOSed, unable to find a valid `roundId`.

This means that users cannot interact with the perennial protocol because the Oracle cannot be synced.
So they cannot close losing trades which is a loss of funds.

The DOS can occur since the while loop searching the phases does not terminate:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to add a check if `minRoundId` is a valid solution for the binary search.
If it is, `minRoundId` should be used to return the result instead of `maxRoundId`:

```diff
         // If the found timestamp is not greater than target timestamp or no max was found, then the desired round does
         // not exist in this phase
-        if (maxTimestamp <= targetTimestamp || maxTimestamp == type(uint256).max) return 0;
+        if ((minTimestamp <= targetTimestamp || minTimestamp == type(uint256).max) && (maxTimestamp <= targetTimestamp || maxTimestamp == type(uint256).max)) return 0;
 
+        if (minTimestamp > targetTimestamp) {
+            return _aggregatorRoundIdToProxyRoundId(phaseId, uint80(minRoundId));
+        }
         return _aggregatorRoundIdToProxyRoundId(phaseId, uint80(maxRoundId));
     }
```

After applying the changes, the binary search only returns `0` if both `minRoundId` and `maxRoundId` are not a valid result.

If this line is passed we know that either of both is valid and we can use `minRoundId` if it is the better result.
