# Spender can redeem more total shares than user intends by front-running BalancedVault.approve()

## Summary
Spender can redeem more total shares than user intends by front-running BalancedVault.approve().

## Vulnerability Detail
Examine [BalancedVault.approve()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L236-L240):
```solidity
function approve(address spender, UFixed18 amount) external returns (bool) {
	allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
	emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
	return true;
}
```

Now consider the following scenario:
1) Alice approves Bob to spend 100 shares
2) Alice changes her mind, and calls approve(address(Bob), 50) to change the amount to 50 shares
3) Bob sees Alice's transaction in the mempool & front-runs it, calling BalancedVault.redeem(100, address(Alice)). This will succeed as Bob is still approved to spend 100 shares until Alice's transaction is processed
4) Bob's transaction is processed first, Alice's 100 shares are set for delayed settlement. Bob's spender limit for Alice's address is set to 0
5) Alice's transaction is subsequently processed, setting Bob's spending limit from 0 to 50
6) Bob calls BalancedVault.redeem(50, address(Alice)) to spend another 50 shares, spending a total of 150 of Alice's shares, when Alice only intends Bob to spend 50.

## Impact
Spender is able to redeem more total shares than the user intends due to Spender being able to front-run BalancedVault.approve().

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
This is a known issue for standard approve() functions; read the [comment above IERC20.approve()](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L52-L66) in OpenZeppelin's implementation. OZ implements [decreaseAllowance() & increaseAllowance()](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L34-L37) functions to work around this issue.
