# Public claim might be problematic

## Summary
While allowing any party to claim on behalf of a user with unclaimed funds in a vault is generally beneficial, it can potentially lead to issues if the total collateral balance is lower than the unclaimed amount. This could result in forced claims and the realization of losses against a user's wishes, particularly problematic for users waiting for collateral balance recovery and DeFi strategies like yield aggregators that prefer to manage loss realization themselves.
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, when a user has a claimable amount in the vault, anyone can initiate the claim on behalf of the user's address, and the claimable funds will be transferred to the user's account. While this is generally a good design, it could lead to potential issues if the total collateral balance is less than the total unclaimed amount. In such cases, the user would only receive a pro-rata share of their total claimable amount.

This might cause problems for users who prefer not to claim and realize losses, choosing instead to remain in the vault until the total collateral balance exceeds the unclaimed amount. However, another party could force a claim and realize the user's losses against their wishes. This could also pose challenges for DeFi strategies like yield aggregators that use perennial vaults, as these strategies usually avoid realizing losses, or if they must, prefer to control the process themselves.
## Impact
It might be a design choice to keep it like this but some users might not want to realize their losses and prefer to wait for the vault to be liquid again. Considering its users funds in the table I'll call this as medium
