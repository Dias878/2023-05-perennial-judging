# Collateral contract is ignoring maker fee in user liquidation process

## Summary
Current user liquidation methods may overlook the impact of maker fees and liquidation fees. The liquidation routine can underestimate the required collateral in scenarios with high maker fees and liquidation fees, causing potential underflows and preventing successful user liquidation.
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, the liquidation process fails to account for the maker fee when liquidating a user's position in the `closeAll()` function. This can present issues if the maker fee is high enough to push the user's collateral balance beneath a certain level, potentially making it impossible to liquidate the user's position.

Additionally, the liquidation fee is currently subtracted from the user's initial collateral balance. However, the user's collateral balance changes when the `closeAll()` function executes. This creates a situation where if the liquidation fee is high enough and the user's collateral is relatively low, it might be impossible to liquidate the user due to underflows.

The issue is with line 123 in the linked code. If a maker fee is present, this line causes the user's collateral balance to decrease, causing a discrepancy between the cached total collateral balance in the contract and the actual total collateral the user holds.

Furthermore, if the fee is greater than the result of collateralForFee multiplied by the liquidation fee, the fee will equal the total collateral, which isn't enough for the user's balance due to the maker fee realized in the `closeAll()` call.
## Impact
Although it's not an everyday scenario and requires the user to have minimal funds it is still viable finding. Especially if the maker fee and the liquidation fee high this can happen more likely. I'll label it as medium
