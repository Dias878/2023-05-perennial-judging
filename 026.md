# _unsettled on Program may calculate rewards even after it ends; which depends on when sync on ProductManager is called

## Summary
_unsettled on Program calculate rewards even after it ends

## Vulnerability Detail
ProgramInfo has a function `amountPerShare` that divides total amount by the duration (in second) of a reward incentive program. The function is used to multiply by the time delta as well as by the position size of a user during `_unsettled` in Program, However the end time(completeVersion) is only updated during a `sync` call on ProductManger. If no one call this function, or this function is called with delay, over-emission of reward would occur.


```solidity
    function amountPerShare(ProgramInfo memory self) internal pure returns (Accumulator memory) {
        return self.amount.div(self.duration);
    }

```

_unsettle, where the `self.versionComplete` would be updated in ProductManger during `sync`
```solidity
    function _unsettled(
        Program storage self,
        IProduct product,
        ProgramInfo memory programInfo,
        address account,
        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory currentOracleVersion
    ) private view returns (UFixed18 amount) {
        // program stage overview
        //
        // V = latest user settle version, V' = current user settle version
        // S = versionStarted, E = versionEnded
        //
        // (1) V   V' S           E        program not yet started
        // (2)   V    S     V'    E        use versionStarted -> V' for userShareDelta
        // (3)        S  V     V' E        use V -> V' for userShareDelta
        // (4)        S     V     E   V'   use V -> versionComplete for userShareDelta
        // (5)        S           E V   V' program already completed
        // (6)   V    S           E   V'   use versionStarted -> versionComplete for userShareDelta
        //
        // NOTE: V == S and V' == E both default to the inner case

        (uint256 _versionStarted, uint256 _versionComplete) = (
            self.versionStarted == 0 ? currentOracleVersion.version : self.versionStarted, // start must be no earlier than current version
            self.versionComplete == 0 ? type(uint256).max : self.versionComplete           // we don't know when completion occurs
        );

        // accruing must start between self.versionStarted and self.versionComplete
        uint256 fromVersion = Math.min(_versionComplete, Math.max(_versionStarted, product.latestVersion(account)));
        // accruing must complete between self.versionStarted and self.versionComplete, we know self.versionStarted must be no earlier than current version
        uint256 toVersion = Math.min(_versionComplete, currentOracleVersion.version);

        Accumulator memory globalShareDelta = product.shareAtVersion(toVersion).sub(product.shareAtVersion(fromVersion));
        Accumulator memory computedUserShareDelta = product.position(account).mul(globalShareDelta);
        amount = UFixed18Lib.from(programInfo.amountPerShare().mul(computedUserShareDelta).sum());
    }
```

ProductManager:sync
```solidity
    function sync(
        ProductManager storage self,
        IProduct product,
        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory currentOracleVersion
    ) internal returns (SyncResult[] memory results) {

        uint256[] memory activeProgramIds = self.activePrograms.values();
        results = new SyncResult[](activeProgramIds.length);

        for (uint256 i; i < activeProgramIds.length; i++) {
            // Load program
            uint256 programId = activeProgramIds[i];
            ProgramInfo memory programInfo = self.programInfos[programId];
            Program storage program = self.programs[programId];

            // If timestamp-started, grab current version (first version after start)
            uint256 versionStarted;
            if (program.versionStarted == 0 && programInfo.isStarted(currentOracleVersion.timestamp)) {
                versionStarted = _start(self, programId, currentOracleVersion);
            }

            // If timestamp-completed, grab previous version (last version before completion)
            uint256 versionComplete;
            if (program.versionComplete == 0 && programInfo.isComplete(currentOracleVersion.timestamp)) {
                versionComplete = _complete(self, product, programId);
            }

            // Save result
            results[i] = SyncResult(programId, versionStarted, versionComplete);
        }
```


## Impact
rewards are can be over-emiited to users if dependent call on sync is delayed due to malicious attack (chain stuffing/going down or simply no one calls it), over-claim may happen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check if the reward has already ended; if so, add a pro-rota calculation to account for the reward the user is eligible to claim
