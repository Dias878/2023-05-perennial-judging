# _unsettled on Program calculate rewards even after it ends

## Summary
_unsettled on Program calculate rewards even after it ends

## Vulnerability Detail
ProgramInfo has a function `amountPerShare` that divides total amount by the duration (in second) of a reward incentive program. However the function is used to multiply by the time delta as well as by the position size of a user during `_unsettled` in Program, without considering if the the reward has already ended in between the the time of claiming.


```solidity
    function amountPerShare(ProgramInfo memory self) internal pure returns (Accumulator memory) {
        return self.amount.div(self.duration);
    }

```

```solidity
    function _unsettled(
        Program storage self,
        IProduct product,
        ProgramInfo memory programInfo,
        address account,
        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory currentOracleVersion
    ) private view returns (UFixed18 amount) {
        // program stage overview
        //
        // V = latest user settle version, V' = current user settle version
        // S = versionStarted, E = versionEnded
        //
        // (1) V   V' S           E        program not yet started
        // (2)   V    S     V'    E        use versionStarted -> V' for userShareDelta
        // (3)        S  V     V' E        use V -> V' for userShareDelta
        // (4)        S     V     E   V'   use V -> versionComplete for userShareDelta
        // (5)        S           E V   V' program already completed
        // (6)   V    S           E   V'   use versionStarted -> versionComplete for userShareDelta
        //
        // NOTE: V == S and V' == E both default to the inner case

        (uint256 _versionStarted, uint256 _versionComplete) = (
            self.versionStarted == 0 ? currentOracleVersion.version : self.versionStarted, // start must be no earlier than current version
            self.versionComplete == 0 ? type(uint256).max : self.versionComplete           // we don't know when completion occurs
        );

        // accruing must start between self.versionStarted and self.versionComplete
        uint256 fromVersion = Math.min(_versionComplete, Math.max(_versionStarted, product.latestVersion(account)));
        // accruing must complete between self.versionStarted and self.versionComplete, we know self.versionStarted must be no earlier than current version
        uint256 toVersion = Math.min(_versionComplete, currentOracleVersion.version);

        Accumulator memory globalShareDelta = product.shareAtVersion(toVersion).sub(product.shareAtVersion(fromVersion));
        Accumulator memory computedUserShareDelta = product.position(account).mul(globalShareDelta);
        amount = UFixed18Lib.from(programInfo.amountPerShare().mul(computedUserShareDelta).sum());
    }
```

## Impact
rewards are wrongly attributed to users, over-claim may happen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check if the reward has already ended; if so, add a pro-rota calculation to account for the reward the user is eligible to claim
