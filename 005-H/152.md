# Unintended Vault Operation Due to Product Settling and Oracle Version Skips

## Summary
Vault operation can behave unexpectedly when products settle and skip versions in their oracles. This problem arises when the vault assumes a non-existent version of a product, leading to miscalculations in the _assetsAtEpoch() function. This inaccuracy can affect the distribution of shares among depositors, redeemers, and claimers, disrupting the balance of the market.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a product progresses to a new version of its oracle, it first settles at the current version plus one, then jumps to the latest version. For instance, if a product's latest version is 20 and the current version is 23, the product will first settle at version 21 and then jump from 21 to 23, bypassing version 22. This process can lead to unintended behavior in the vault, particularly if the vault's deposited epoch points to the bypassed version, which can result in a potential underflow and subsequent rounding to zero.

Consider this scenario: A vault is operating with two markets, each having two products. Let's assume the vault has equal positions and collateral in both markets, with all assets priced at $1 for simplicity. Also, assume that Market0 contains product A and product B, while Market1 contains product C and product D.

The latest version of product A is 20, while the vault's latest epoch is 2, which corresponds to version 20 for product A. Similarly, the latest version of product C is 10, with the vault's latest epoch at 2, corresponding to version 10 for product A.

Assume there are no positions created in product C, D, and also no deposits made to the vault, meaning the vault has not opened any positions on these products either. The oracle version for product C, D gets updated twice consecutively. Since there are no open positions in product C, D, their products will progress to version 12 directly, bypassing version 11.

This circumstance renders the epoch stale, which will lead to miscalculations in deposits, claims, and redemptions. During the _assetsAtEpoch() function, the vault incorrectly assumes that there is a version 11 of product C, D. However, these products have skipped version 11 and advanced to 12. Since the latest version of product C, D is greater than the version the vault holds, the vault presumes that version 11 exists. However, as version 11 doesn't exist, the _accumulatedAtEpoch will be the negative of whatever was deposited. This leads the vault to incorrectly assume a large loss in that market. Consequently, depositors can gain more shares, while redeemers and claimers may receive fewer shares.

## Impact
If the above scenario happens, vault users can incur extreme losses on claim and redeem operations and depositors can earn uneven shares.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't check +1 version, check the current version recorded for that epoch in vault and the latest version of the product, cover all the versions
