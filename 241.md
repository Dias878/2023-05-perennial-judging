# resolveShortfall fails when contract is paused

## Summary
```resolveShortfall``` fails when contract is paused
## Vulnerability Detail
```resolveShortfall``` is an emergency function that is used to ``` re-capitalize an insolvent market``` by ```the product owner or an insurance fund``` but this function cannot be called when contract is paused. Even though it might be required to save users or the protocol in dire situations
## Impact
```solidity

    /**
     * @notice Injects additional collateral into a product to resolve shortfall
     * @dev Shortfall is a measure of settled insolvency in the market
     *      This hook can be used by the product owner or an insurance fund to re-capitalize an insolvent market
     * @param product Product to resolve shortfall for
     * @param amount Amount of shortfall to resolve
     */
     //@audit-issue shortfall should be resolvable while contract is paused
    function resolveShortfall(IProduct product, UFixed18 amount) external isProduct(product) notPaused {
        _products[product].resolve(amount);
        token.pull(msg.sender, amount);

        emit ShortfallResolution(product, amount);
    }
```

Product Owner cannot recapitalize the market if briefly paused for recapitalization
