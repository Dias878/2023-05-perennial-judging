# No chainlink L2 sequencer uptime feed

## Summary
The abscense of a chainlink L2 sequencer on Arbitrum can lead to stale data.
## Vulnerability Detail
Perennial works on Ethereum and arbitrum. This problem will only occur on Arbitrum.
Optimistic rollup protocols transfer all execution from the Layer 1 (L1) Ethereum chain to a Layer 2 (L2) chain, perform the execution on the L2 chain, and then return the results to the L1 chain. The L2 protocols have a sequencer that batch multiple transaction in one. It is possible that such sequencer becomes unavailable, in that case, it will be impossible to get current data.
## Impact
For perennial in particular, this means that when such sequencer becomes unavailable, the price feeds will become outdated. Any trades executed during that period, will be based on wrong data. 
## Code Snippet
[ChainlinkFeedOracle.sol#L92-L159](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/ChainlinkFeedOracle.sol#L92-L159)
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A recommendation for this problem is to use a sequencer. A sequencer is used, so the answer that [`getLatestRound()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/ChainlinkFeedOracle.sol#L94) returns should be checked. Additionally `startedAt` should be added to the return values of `getLatestRound()` to check if the grace period has passed after the sequencer is back up.
```solidity
        // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }

        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the sequencer is back up.
        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
            revert GracePeriodNotOver();
        }
```
