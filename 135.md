# Chainlink oracle may return stale price when L2 sequencer is down

## Summary

Chainlink oracle may return stale price when L2 sequencer is down

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the audit description, index will be deployed on L2 Arbitrum.     
From [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds), If a sequencer becomes unavailable, ChainlinkAggregator may return stale price.  
Arbitrum recently experienced just such an [incident](https://twitter.com/ArbitrumDevs/status/1667333516441403393)

Note that It is a different issue from checking oracle price freshness.        
Because in the case of sharp price fluctuations, the price may be updated several times, although the final price is in freshness, but it may not be the latest price.     

## Impact

Stale price affects protocol and user funds.
