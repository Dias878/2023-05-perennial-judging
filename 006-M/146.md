# Borrowers can liquidated when they are not in bad debt.

## Summary
Borrowers can be liquidatable when they are not in bad debt.
## Vulnerability Detail
To liquidate any account, liquidate() function checks that the borrower maintenance is greater than user collateral or not. Borrowers can be liquidated if the borrower's maintenance is greater than the collateral. 

```solidity
function liquidatable(address account, IProduct product) external view returns (bool) {
        if (product.isLiquidating(account)) return false;

        return product.maintenance(account).gt(collateral(account, product));
    } 
```
the liquidatable() function checks that correctly.
```solidity
if (!totalMaintenance.gt(totalCollateral))
            revert CollateralCantLiquidate(totalMaintenance, totalCollateral); 
```
But liquidate() function is not checking that correctly. When the borrower maintenance is equal to the borrower collateral, the position should be safe and liquidate() function should revert.
## Impact
Early liquidation. Borrowers can lose their collaterals.

## Recommendation
```solidity
if (totalCollateral >= totalMaintenance)
            revert CollateralCantLiquidate(totalMaintenance, totalCollateral); 
```
Or check with the liquidatable() function.
