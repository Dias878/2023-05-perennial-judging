# Consecutive stale epochs may lead to incorrect redeeming of balanced vault shares

## Summary
A malicious user can transfer her own `pendingRedemption` from one epoch to another if there are consecutive stale epochs.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following logic is applied during redeeming, when an epoch is marked as stale in balanced vault:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L191-L194

The pending redemption is marked for `context.epoch + 1`. We will refer to current epoch (`context.epoch`) as `N` for the rest of the explanation to make it simpler.

The pending redemption will be claimable at `N+2` as seen in `_settle`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L413-L421

which means that if the epoch `N+1` is stale as well. The user can update the variable `pendingEpoch` to be `N+2`, making the sum of the shares claimable all together in `N+3`. This is unexpected since the value of shares is not the same accross epochs.

## Impact
If stale epochs are common, a user can redeem from consecutive epochs, and if during the second one share value is greater, the user has profited and stolen from the vault.

An epoch is more likely to be stale (and thus 2 epochs being stale consecutively) if the number of markets used in the balanced vault is large. 

Indeed any market verifying the condition:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L361-L362
will cause the epoch to be stale in the vault.

## Recommendation
Check if there is already a non-zero pending redemption scheduled for a different epoch than `context.epoch + 1`
