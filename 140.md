# Vault deposit does not check for resulting zero shares

## Summary

Vault deposit does not check for resulting zero shares

## Vulnerability Detail

When a deposit is made to the vault, the function `_convertToShares` is called to convert the assets to shares:

```solidity
    function _convertToShares(EpochContext memory context, UFixed18 assets) private pure returns (UFixed18) {
        if (context.latestAssets.isZero()) return assets;
        return assets.muldiv(context.latestShares, context.latestAssets);
    }
```

There is the possibility of depositing a small amount of assets and zero shares getting minted due to the rounding down of shares. This would lead to a loss for the depositor.

## Impact

Loss of assets for the depositor
