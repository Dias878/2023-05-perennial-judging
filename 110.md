# XO-`accumulate()` function can crash if to`Timestamp` is less than `fromTimestamp`

## Summary
- the vulnerability in the  `accumulate()`  function is used to calculate the interest earned on a loan, the `accumulate()` function does not take into account the fact that the` toTimestamp` can be less than the `fromTimestamp`, this can cause the contract to crash and can lead to losses for users in financial and also may lose their collateral or be unable to repay their loans.
## Vulnerability Detail
 ```solidity
function accumulate(
        JumpRateUtilizationCurve6 memory self,
        UFixed6 utilization,
        uint256 fromTimestamp,
        uint256 toTimestamp,
        UFixed6 notional
    ) internal pure returns (Fixed6) {
        return compute(self, utilization)
            .mul(Fixed6Lib.from(int256(toTimestamp - fromTimestamp)))
            .mul(Fixed6Lib.from(notional))
            .div(Fixed6Lib.from(365 days));
    }
}
```
- the `accumulate()` function is vulnerable, so the problem is the `accumulate()` function is used to calculate the interest earned on a loan. and the `accumulate()` function does not take into account the fact that the `toTimestamp` can be less than the `fromTimestamp`. This can happen if the user changes the `toTimestamp` before the `loan` is repaid, If the` toTimestamp` is less than the `fromTimestamp`, then the `accumulate()` function will divide by `0`, this problem will cause the contract to crash and can result in financial losses for users, as they may lose their `collatera`l or be unable to repay their loans.
## Impact
- this vulnerability can cause to  contract to crashes, and then  users may lose their collateral or be unable to repay their loans. This could result in significant financial losses for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adding to the `accumulate` function a check  to see if the `toTimestamp` is less than the `fromTimestamp`. If it is, then the `accumulate` function should return `0`. This will prevent the contract from crashing and protect users from `financial losses.`
