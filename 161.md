# XO-`computeFee` function allows attacker to avoid paying fees

## Summary
- The vulnerability  in the `computeFee` function allows an attacker to avoid paying `fees.` Thie vulnerability occurs when the `takerFee` is set to zero. The attacker can exploit this bug by sending a transaction that sets the `takerFee` to zero. This will cause the `computeFee` function to return a zero fee, which will allow the attacker to avoid paying fees for their `trades.`
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
*/
    function computeFee(
        PrePosition memory self,
        IOracleProvider.OracleVersion memory latestOracleVersion
    ) internal view returns (Position memory) {
        Position memory positionDelta = self.openPosition.add(self.closePosition);

        (UFixed18 makerNotional, UFixed18 takerNotional) = (
            Fixed18Lib.from(positionDelta.maker).mul(latestOracleVersion.price).abs(),
            Fixed18Lib.from(positionDelta.taker).mul(latestOracleVersion.price).abs()
        );

        IProduct product = IProduct(address(this));
        return Position(makerNotional.mul(product.makerFee()), takerNotional.mul(product.takerFee()));
    }

```
- The vulnerability is exist in the `computeFee` function, so the problem is that there is line that calculates the taker fee, it does not take into account the fact that the `takerFee` can be zero. If the `takerFee` is zero, then the `takerNotional` will be multiplied by zero, which will result in a zero fee.
-This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to avoid paying fees. For example, the attacker could send a transaction that sets the `takerFee` to zero. This would cause the `computeFee` function to return a zero fee, which would allow the attacker to avoid paying fees for their trades.
## Impact
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to avoid paying fees, which leading in financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The `takerFee` variable should be checked to make sure it is not zero. If it is zero, then the `takerNotional` should be multiplied by zero instead of the `takerFee.`
