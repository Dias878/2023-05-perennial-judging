# Griefing attack against users in `BalancedVault`

## Summary

Griefing attack against users in `BalancedVault`

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can call `BalancedVault::syncAccount` on behalf of another user

```solidity
    function syncAccount(address account) public {
        (EpochContext memory context, ) = _settle(account);
        _rebalance(context, UFixed18Lib.ZERO);
    }
```

A malicious person can call this function specifying another user's address to disadvantage them at times when it would lead them to make a loss.

This is made possible because the update of prices is predictable. The malicious user could therefore time unfavorable price movements to disadvantage a user.

## Impact
