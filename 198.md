# Malicious user can send protocol fees to address 0

## Summary
Malicious user can send protocol fees to address 0. It's possible, because 1)protocol coordinator is created, then treasury 0 is provided, 2)updateCoordinatorTreasury doesn't check for 0 address.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Incentivizer.claimFee` can be called by anyone [to send fees to protocol's treasury](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/incentivizer/Incentivizer.sol#L219).

This can be a poblem when fees are not 0 and treasury is 0.
Protocol's treasury can be 0 for 2 reasons:
1.At the beginning, [no treasury is provided for protocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/controller/Controller.sol#L106-L118).
2.Treasury update [doesn't check for 0 address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/controller/Controller.sol#L153-L156).

As result, malicious user can claim fees fro a protocol, right when treasury is 0.
## Impact
Protocol losses fees.
