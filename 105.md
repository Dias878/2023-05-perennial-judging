# Oracles would not work on Arbitrum

## Summary

Oracles would not work on Arbitrum

## Vulnerability Detail

Perrenial uses Chainlink protocol as an oracle service. The address of its feed registry is hardcoded during deployment in `ChainlinkOracle.sol`:
```solidity
File: ChainlinkOracle.sol
42:     constructor(ChainlinkRegistry registry_, address base_, address quote_) {
43:         registry = registry_;
44:         base = base_;
45:         quote = quote_;
46: 
47:         // phaseId is 1-indexed, skip index 0
48:         _phases.push(Phase(uint128(0), uint128(0)));
49:         // phaseId is 1-indexed, first phase starts as version 0
50:         _phases.push(Phase(uint128(0), uint128(registry_.getStartingRoundId(base_, quote_, 1))));
51: 
52:         _decimalOffset = SafeCast.toInt256(10 ** registry_.decimals(base, quote));
53:     }
```

However, while Feed Registry exists on mainnet, it's not present on expected L2 chain Arbitrum:
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/feed-registry#contract-addresses

This would leave Arbitrum instances of Perrenial without access to current prices, breaking all core functionality.

## Impact

Oracles would not work on Arbitrum, protocol functionality would be broken since no prices could be received.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider updating oracle functionality in a way that it uses direct Chainlin price feeds instead of a registry on Arbitrum.
