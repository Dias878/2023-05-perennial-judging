# Multi Invoker cannot be initialized

## Summary

MultiInvoker will be upgraded . The current multi invoker is of version 2 . Therefore , to re-initialize the contract, the version should be 3 . 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `initialize` function , the initializer version is 2 instead of 3 . Therefore , if any of the below contracts are to be updated , the initializer will need to be called. 
- batcher
- collateral
- reserve

But as the version is 2 , it will fail.

While discussing this with the sponsor, they conveyed they don't intend to change the current contracts, but as it was not mentioned in the docs or audit note. I consider it a valid issue.

## Impact

Multi invoker will not be able to approve the contracts if needed
