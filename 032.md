# There is no way for BalancedVault to re-set allowance for Collateral to 0

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
upon initialize, the vault would call approve to the collateral, in order for the vault to call subsequent deposit to the collateral. However there is no way to reset this allowance to 0 in case of a bug happens on the Collateral side.

## Impact
Lack of emergency protection; a potential knock-on effect on the vault in case of vulnerability on the Collateral.
