# `0` (`address(0)`) would be assigned into the `onlyOwner()` modifier on each update function, which lead to a bad situation that each parameter would never be able to updated

## Summary
Within the Controller contract, the `onlyOwner()` modifier would be applied to each update functions.

However, within the update functions defined in the  Controller contract, `0` (`address(0)`) would be assigned into the `onlyOwner()` modifier. 

Due to that, within the Controller contract, every time the transaction would be reverted when each update function would be called. And therefore, each parameters that is supposed to be updated by calling the each update function would never be able to be updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the Controller#`updateCollateral()`, the caller would be checked via the `onlyOwner()` modifier like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial/contracts/controller/Controller.sol#L181
```solidity
    function updateCollateral(ICollateral newCollateral) public onlyOwner(0) { /// @audit
```

Within the `onlyOwner()`, the `_checkOwner()` would be called. And within the `_checkOwner()`, it would be revert if the caller would be the address besides `msg.sender` like this:
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol#L36
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol#L51
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
     */
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        _checkOwner();  /// @audit
        _;
    }
```
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Throws if the sender is not the owner.
     */
    function _checkOwner() internal view virtual {
        require(owner() == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");  /// @audit
    }
```

However, within the Controller#`updateCollateral()`, `0` (`address(0)`) would be assigned into the `onlyOwner()` modifier. Therefore, when the Controller#`updateCollateral()` would be called, the transaction would always be reverted. As a result, the collateral would never be updated.

By the way, within the Controller, this vulnerability would be applied to not only the Controller#`updateCollateral()` but also the other update functions like this:
- Controller#`updateIncentivizer()`
- Controller#`updateProductBeacon()`
- Controller#`updateMultiInvoker()` 
  etc...
  (NOTEï¼šPlease see the "Code Snippet" below in order to confirm all update functions that are affected by this vulnerability)

Thus, when the updates functions above would be called, these transaction would always be reverted. As a result, the parameters that is updated by these update functions above would also never be able to be updated.


## Impact
Within the Controller contract, every time the transaction would be reverted when each update function would be called. And therefore, each parameters that is supposed to be updated by calling the each update function would never be able to be updated.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
For example, within the Controller#`updateCollateral()`,
Consider just removing the argument from the `onlyOwner()` modifier like this: 
```solidity
+   function updateCollateral(ICollateral newCollateral) public onlyOwner {
-   function updateCollateral(ICollateral newCollateral) public onlyOwner(0) {
        ...
```
Or, consider assigning the `msg.sender` instead of assigning `0` like this:
```solidity
+   function updateCollateral(ICollateral newCollateral) public onlyOwner(msg.sender) {
-   function updateCollateral(ICollateral newCollateral) public onlyOwner(0) {
        ...
```

Then, the solution like above should be applied to other update functions in the Controller contract.
