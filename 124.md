# Collaterals might be incorrectly valued when DSU or USDC depegs leading to under collateralized positions

## Summary
When DSU or USDC depegs, user collaterals will be incorrectly valued, potentially causing user taking on leverages unsafe to the products and protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
Both a wrapped coin and a stable coin can depeg due to many factors. This has happened more than once. [The recent incident](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-and-why-do-stablecoins-depeg) is USDC, Dai, and USDT depeg due to sillcon valley bank collapse. A depeg tends to lead to immediate panic trading and increasing arbitrage that destabilizes defi markets. 

When a user deposits, they either deposit USDC at the front end or DSU directly to the smart contract. Eventually, DSU is stored as collaterals. When an account is evaluated for liquidation, the positions are multiplied by oracle prices than scaled based on a maintenance factor, the number is then compared directly with the collateral DSU amount. 

```solidity
//Collateral.sol
    function liquidatable(address account, IProduct product) external view returns (bool) {
        if (product.isLiquidating(account)) return false;
|>        return product.maintenance(account).gt(collateral(account, product));
    }
```
```solidity
//AccountPosition.sol
    function _maintenance(Position memory position) private view returns (UFixed18) {
        IProduct product = IProduct(address(this));
        Fixed18 oraclePrice = product.currentVersion().price;
|>       UFixed18 notionalMax = Fixed18Lib.from(position.max()).mul(oraclePrice).abs();
        return notionalMax.mul(product.maintenance());
    }
```
```solidity
//Collateral.sol
    function collateral(address account, IProduct product) public view returns (UFixed18) {
|>        return _products[product].balances[account];
    }
```
Since in ChainlinkOracle.sol, prices are supposedly fetched denominated in USD, this comparison equates USD with DSU. While this is fine in most cases, when USDC or DSU depegs, this equation would be broken and there is no mechanism in current implementation to check or handle this.

```solidity
//ChainlinkOracle.sol
    function currentVersion() public view returns (OracleVersion memory oracleVersion) {
        return _buildOracleVersion(registry.getLatestRound(base, quote));
    }
```
```solidity
//ChainlinkRegistry.sol
    function getLatestRound(ChainlinkRegistry self, address base, address quote) internal view returns (ChainlinkRound memory) {
        (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) =
            FeedRegistryInterface(ChainlinkRegistry.unwrap(self)).latestRoundData(base, quote);
        return ChainlinkRound({roundId: roundId, timestamp: updatedAt, answer: answer});
    }
```
```solidity
//ChainlinkOracle.sol
    function _buildOracleVersion(ChainlinkRound memory round, uint256 version)
    private view returns (OracleVersion memory) {
        Fixed18 price = Fixed18Lib.ratio(round.answer, _decimalOffset);
        return OracleVersion({ version: version, timestamp: round.timestamp, price: price });
    }
```
## Impact

When DSU drops significantly below us dollar, users can be under collateralized putting protocol and product at risks. When the depegs happen, it could take place swiftly with significant price drops. Without an on-chain check, a protocol-wide pause might be needed after the fact to halt all activities, however, such a remedy will not be prompt to prevent early and drastic impact on users and products.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding check for DSU price deviation in ChainlinkOracle.sol. For example, in `_buildOracleVersion(ChainlinkRound memory round, uint256 version)`, add a check for DSU price in a separate price feed like UniswapV3, and round timestamp can be used to access a record price when needed.
