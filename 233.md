# Balanced Vault Upgrade can trigger a mass liquidation event

## Summary

`maxCollateral` or `targetLeverage` can be changed to lower values than that of previous values during upgrade, which will trigger liquidation events when `new targetLeverage < old targetLeverage` OR `new maxCollateral < old maxCollateral`

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/0f73469508a4cd3d90b382eac2112f012a5a9852/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVaultDefinition.sol#L86-L88

```solidity
targetLeverage = targetLeverage_;

maxCollateral = maxCollateral_;
```

When upgrading vault from previous implementation to new one, it should have `previousImplementation_.maxCollateral <= maxCollateral_` and `previousImplementation_.targetLeverage <= targetLeverage_`. 

Although, there is no check like this while upgrading, so new contract could have smaller values than what previous implementation had. As a result, it will make all the already opened positions which was leveraging `previousImplementation_.targetLeverage`, to get liquidated as after upgrade : `new targetLeverage < prevImpl.targetLeverage`.

Reducing the `maxCollateral` parameter means that the upgraded vault will have a lower limit on the total amount of collateral it can hold. If the existing positions in the vault exceed this new limit, it can result in insufficient collateral capacity to support those positions. This can lead to liquidation events causing financial losses for the vault users.

As can be seen below, in constructor, if `long` and `short` from the previous markets are checked, we suggest to check `maxCollateral` and `targetLeverage` also while upgrading.

```solidity
uint256 previousTotalMarkets_ = previousImplementation_.totalMarkets();
if (previousTotalMarkets_ > totalMarkets_) revert BalancedVaultDefinitionMarketsMismatchedWithPreviousImplementationError();
for (uint256 marketId; marketId < previousTotalMarkets_; marketId++) {
    MarketDefinition memory previousMarket_ = previousImplementation_.markets(marketId);
    if (previousMarket_.long != marketDefinitions_[marketId].long) revert BalancedVaultDefinitionMarketsMismatchedWithPreviousImplementationError();
    if (previousMarket_.short != marketDefinitions_[marketId].short) revert BalancedVaultDefinitionMarketsMismatchedWithPreviousImplementationError();
}
```

## Impact

Upgrade can trigger a mass liquidation event if upgraded with a lower `maxCollateral` or `targetLeverage`. Thus causing financial losses for the vault users.

## Recommendation

We recommend to have a check while upgrading in constructor to make sure new `maxCollateral` or `targetLeverage` is not lower than previous one.
