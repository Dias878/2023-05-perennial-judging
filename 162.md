# XO-`deductFee` function allows attacker to avoid paying `fees`

## Summary
- The vulnerability in deductFee function, cause an issues  that it does not take into account the fact that the `newProgramAmount` can be zero. If the `newProgramAmount` is zero, then the `programFeeAmount` will also be zero. this could be exploited by an attacker to avoid paying fees.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
*/
    function deductFee(ProgramInfo memory programInfo, UFixed18 incentivizationFee)
    internal pure returns (UFixed18)  {
        Position memory newProgramAmount = programInfo.amount.mul(UFixed18Lib.ONE.sub(incentivizationFee));
        UFixed18 programFeeAmount = programInfo.amount.sub(newProgramAmount).sum();
        programInfo.amount = newProgramAmount;
        return programFeeAmount;
    }
    /**
```
- There is a vulnerability  in the `deductFee` function. The function calculates the fee amount by subtracting the `newProgramAmount` from the `programInfo.amount.` The problem with this is that the `newProgramAmount` can be zero, which would cause the `programFeeAmount` to be zero.
- This vulnerability  could be exploited by an attacker to avoid paying fees. For example, the attacker could send a transaction that sets the `incentivizationFee` to a very high value. This would cause the `newProgramAmount` to be zero, which would in turn cause the `programFeeAmount` to be zero. This would allow the attacker to avoid paying fees for their trades.
## Impact
-  The vulnerability allows an attacker to avoid paying fees, which could result in financial losses.
-  The attacker only needs to send a transaction that sets the `incentivizationFee` to zero to exploit this vulnerability .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `deductFee` function should be changed to check if the incentive fee is zero. If the incentive fee is zero, the function should return a `fee` of zero.
