# Closed products can lead vaults to incur losses

## Summary
Closing either the long or short product within a market can cause a vault to lose its capacity to hedge effectively, exposing it to risk on one side and due to how rebalancing is limited in the code, liquidations might be applicable to the non-closed market.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a long or short product within a market closes, the vault cannot effectively hedge its position as the closed market prevents the vault from opening new positions. If one market shuts down, the vault should ideally halt operations because it will only have exposure on one side.

Consider a scenario where the short market closes. It's likely that participants (takers) start leaving that market. If the number of takers becomes extremely low or hits zero, that product won't generate any funding position or position P&L. The paired market (long market in this case), however, remains active and may still experience losses or profits.

Rebalancing becomes challenging because the code checks if a market is closed, which prevents the active market from adjusting its position. If the number of takers in a product drops significantly or to zero (a probable scenario after a market closes), the corresponding market should also shut down, given that the closed market is no longer hedging the vault's position. Currently, the code does not include an emergency withdrawal or a similar mechanism to protect the vault's position.

For instance, suppose a vault holds equal collateral (100-100) and positions (100-100) in both long and short products, operating at 1x leverage with a price of $1. If the short market closes and eventually all takers leave due to no profits in a closed market, an adverse movement in the long market (like a $50 loss due to price dropping to $0.5) cannot be hedged by the other market. This scenario can lead to potential liquidation of the long market.

## Impact
Since vault has no functionality to cover this scenario and it can lead to serious losses I'll label it as high

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If a product is closed, then close the opposing product aswell to maintain the hedge. Emergency functions should be introduced aswell if a product is closed for good and will never be open again.
