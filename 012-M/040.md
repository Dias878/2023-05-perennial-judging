# Payoff definitions that can cross zero price are not supported

## Summary
The price that is returned by an Oracle can be transformed by a "Payoff Provider" to transform the Oracle price and implement different payoff functions (e.g. 3x Leveraged ETH, ETH*ETH).

According to the documentation, any payoff function is supported:

The problem is that this is not true.

## Vulnerability Detail
Payoff functions that transform the Oracle price such that the transformed price can cross from negative to positive or from positive to negative are not supported.

This is because there is a location in the code, where there is division by `currentPrice`:

Thus there is a risk of division-by-zero if the price was allowed to cross the 0 value.

## Impact
In contrast to what is specified in the Docs, not all payoff functions are supported which can lead to a situation where it causes division-by-zero and thereby DOS.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Establish which payoff functions are supported and make it clear in the docs or find a meaningful way to handle the above case.
If `currentPrice==0`, a meaningful value could be to set `currentPrice=1`
