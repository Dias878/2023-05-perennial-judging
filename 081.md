# Avoiding SafeMath in Solidity Versions Higher than 0.8.0

## Summary
This audit report highlights the recommendation of not using the SafeMath library in Solidity versions higher than 0.8.0 It explains the vulnerability associated with SafeMath and suggests an alternative approach for arithmetic operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
This audit report highlights the recommendation of not using the SafeMath library in Solidity versions higher than 0.8.0 It explains the vulnerability associated with SafeMath and suggests an alternative approach for arithmetic operations.

## Impact
The vulnerability arises due to the change in arithmetic overflow and underflow behavior introduced in Solidity version 0.8. Starting from Solidity 0.8.0, arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) automatically check for overflow and underflow conditions. This update eliminates the need for the SafeMath library, which was previously used to prevent these arithmetic issues.

## Code Snippet
Entire file BalancedVault.sol, example https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-perennial/blob/main/perennial-mono/packages/perennial-vaults/contracts/balanced/BalancedVault.sol#L217
```solidity
 /**
     * @notice Claims all claimable assets for account, sending assets to account
     * @param account The account to claim for
     */
    function claim(address account) external {
        (EpochContext memory context, ) = _settle(account);

        UFixed18 unclaimedAmount = _unclaimed[account];
        UFixed18 unclaimedTotal = _totalUnclaimed;
        _unclaimed[account] = UFixed18Lib.ZERO;
        _totalUnclaimed = unclaimedTotal.sub(unclaimedAmount);
        emit Claim(msg.sender, account, unclaimedAmount);

        // pro-rate if vault has less collateral than unclaimed
        UFixed18 claimAmount = unclaimedAmount;
        UFixed18 totalCollateral = _assets();
        if (totalCollateral.lt(unclaimedTotal)) claimAmount = claimAmount.muldiv(totalCollateral, unclaimedTotal);

        _rebalance(context, claimAmount);

        asset.push(account, claimAmount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Using SafeMath in Solidity versions higher than 0.8.0 introduces unnecessary complexity and redundant code. It can also lead to higher gas consumption and potential compatibility issues when interacting with other contracts that do not utilize SafeMath.
